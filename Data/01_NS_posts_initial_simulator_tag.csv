36972,16,"<p>I'd like to learn how to program in Assembler. I've done a bit of assembly before (during my A-Level Computing course) but that was very definitely a simplified 'pseudo-assembler'. I've borrowed my Dad's old Z80 Assembler reference manual, and that seems quite interesting so if possible I'd like to have a go with Z80 assembler.</p>

<p>However, I don't have a Z80 processor to hand, and would like to do it on my PC (I have windows or linux so either is good). I've found various assemblers around on the internet, but I'm not particularly interested in assembling down to a hex file, I want to just be able to assemble it to something that some kind of simulator on the PC can run. Preferably this simulator would show me the contents of all the registers, memory locations etc, and let me step through instructions. I've found a few bits of software that suggest they might do this - but they either refuse to compile, or don't seem to work properly. Has anyone got any suggestions? If there are good simulator/IDE things available for another type of assembler then I could try that instead (assuming there is a good online reference manual available).</p>

0,6,"<p>Over the years I've worked on a number of microcontroller-based projects; mostly with Microchip's PICs. I've used various microcontroller simulators, and while they can be very helpful at times, I often find myself frustrated. In real life microcontrollers never exist alone and the firmware's behavior is dependent on the environment. However, none of the sims I've used provide decent support for anything outside the microcontroller.</p>

<p>My first thought was to model the entire board in Verilog. But, I'd rather not create an entire CPU model, and I haven't had much luck finding existing models for the chips I use. Regardless, I really don't need, or want, to simulate the proc at that level of detail, and I'd like to retain the debugging facilities provided by a regular processor sim.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the ideal solution would be a hybrid simulator that interfaces a traditional processor simulator with a Verilog model.</p>

<p>Does such a thing exist?</p>

5892435,5,"<p><strong>Background</strong>:</p>

<p>I have a tab bar application. Each tab contains navigation controller allowing the user to transition from one view to the other showing a drill down information of the data (each view is being handled by a view controller and each view controller class has <code>didReceiveMemoryWarning</code> method). Lists are populated by pulling the data from web services.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>:</p>

<p>When i use ""Hardware > Simulate Memory Warning"" option of iPhone Simulator, the <code>didReceiveMemoryWarning</code> method is called for ALL my view controllers - even the one which the user is viewing. I don't want to clear any content which is being used by the active view controller. How can I achieve that? </p>

<p>Which method should have the implementation to reload the data after the data was released because of memory warning? (I see that the view controller classes that contain a table view call <code>viewDidLoad</code> method when user comes back to that view, but if the view contains (say UIWebView) then <code>viewDidLoad</code> method is not called. Why is that?) </p>

<p><strong>Edited (Friday 30 January 2009 - 03:10 PM)</strong></p>

<p>(Note: I'm using Interface builder for creating views, and <code>loadView</code> method is commented out.)</p>

<p>So, when a view controller receives a memory warning message, these are the steps that are carried out:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Following method is called:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)didReceiveMemoryWarning {
    [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]; 
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>As a result of call to <code>[super didReceiveMemoryWarning]</code>, <code>[self setView:nil]</code> gets automatically called?</p></li>
<li><p>If any resources should be cleared, then <code>setView</code> method should be overwritten to clear local resources. </p></li>
<li><p><code>[self setView:nil]</code> is not called if the view is currently active (By default). Right? - I'm really curious which method takes this decision and how?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Can you please confirm. Plus, I was getting an error following this approach but adding <code>myObject = nil</code> after releasing <code>myObject</code> in <code>dealloc</code> method of controller class fixed the issue. Thanks.</p>

0,2,"<p>I've this system that consists of lots of different stages piped together.
Specifically, I've got lots of different processes that communicate via tcp-ip; messages are exchanged
via a packet oriented protocol (more messages can be stuffed together in a single wire-protocol data unit
if certains conditions are met); I've control flow queues too - sockets are non blocking, if I fail to send
I queue messages or even coalesce them in the send queue;
of course what happens at runtime depends on tcp ip control flow underneath, so I'd like to model the tcp ip queues, too.
So the question is - can anyone share their thoughts on how to make a simulation for my system?
I've thought to make a simulator for it - that is: a program with a queue data structure for every queue
I have in my model, for each time tick I make the model evolve according to my understanding of the sytstem
i.e. if the data structure for the tcp buffer in my model says it has space enough I decrement the message number
in the output queue and decrease the available space counter in the tcp buffer model by the size of the message, and so on - then I make the
tcp buffer empty at a rate based on the bandwidth for the tcp link
(of course I'm making the hypothesis that I'm pumping lots of data and that the only parameter for the tcp link
is bandwidth).
Building such a thing seems a lot of effort and I'm not sure it is what I need.
Maybe I'd better off with some kind of excel spreadsheet model, but I'm not sure how to structure it.</p>

0,1,"<p>I'm having trouble running the Leaks Instrument since installing the 3.0 SDK. An NDA disclaimer here I don't think this is a 3.0 SDK issue, just a configuration problem. So I'm looking for advice on configuring the tools in question not the 3.0 SDK per se.</p>

<p>Here’s the breakdown of the behavior I am seeing.</p>

<p>My Application is compiled to OS version 2.2. I can run it out of XCode in debug mode on the Simulator and Device running 2.2, 2.2.1, 3.0.</p>

<p>If I start it with Performance Tools -> Leaks, I get an error message from the OS,  “The application xxxx quit unexpectedly”, “Ignore, Report, Relaunch.” If I click “Ignore” one of two things will happen, either Leaks tells me it couldn’t attach, or Leaks stop responding to input and I have to Force Quit.  Interesting thing is the Simulator starts in 3.0 OS.</p>

<p>If I start Instruments Manually and attach to a running 2.2 Simulator it shows the same behavior.</p>

<p>If I attach Leaks to an iPhone Device it works.</p>

<p>It seems that once I launch Leaks my app won't run in the simulator until I do a new build.</p>

<p>Any ideas for getting my Simulator/Leaks/Xcode synced back up?</p>

I have finished the GDI backbuffer renderer and the whole GUI (couple of more things to adjust) but i am very near to completion. The only big obstacles that last are ball to ball collision (but i can fix this on my own) but the biggest problem of them all is the bouncing of the balls.

<p>Any ideas as to why this gcc-4.0.x bug creeps into the simulator, when in fact the simulator is supposed to be using gcc-4.2.x where this bug has been fixed?</p>

0,1,"<p>I did an wave animation to explore features of sgx chip which is tile-based rendering (TBR) architecture by comparing the performance on iphone and laptop. 
An advantage of TBR architecture is it allows the GPU to perform hidden surface removal before fragments are processed, so I draw many overlaped layers of animated waves, and only the wave in the top layer is visible. 
I did this program on both iphone 3gs (using gles 2.0) and my laptop, a macbook pro(using opengl 2.0). I recorded the fps numbers of different layers, and I assume trends of fps changes on iphone and laptop are different. I guess the performance's decreasing of iphone should be slower than on laptop, when the number of layers is increased. But they have very similar trends.</p>

<p>I have 2 questions.
1. why it doesn't show the advantage of TBR architecture, while there are alot of overlapped triangles
2. why the performance of iphone simulator is much much much much slower than just running on laptop(without simulator)? As documentations say the simulator does not enforce the memory limitations of MBX and SGX and take the advantage of laptop's CPU, i guess its performance should keep up with the laptop.</p>

<p>anyone can help?
thanks alot </p>

1952871,3,"<p>This is a pretty basic question. I am wondering if the <a href=""http://www.udk.com/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Unreal Development Kit</a> can be used for something other than games, specifically a light show simulator and editor. The site says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unreal Engine 3 has been used by game developers, researchers, television studios, machinima directors, artists and students. If you have an idea that needs to be brought to life in a game engine, UDK is for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I have the feeling that it is more game oriented. For my hobby project, I would like to be able to create light show simulations with rotating/moving lasers/lights of changing color, synchronized to sound/music. I would also like to develop an GUI editor for this, preferably in C#, but if it's not possible to access the rendering functionality of the engine from C#, then C++/Qt should suffice. The editor would be used to design the simulation, which would then be rendered/played out in real time.</p>

<p>I guess my base, general question is: can the Unreal Development Kit be used for something like this, not necessarily game related? Or should I go with my original option of Ogre3D, which just focuses on rendering and 3D graphics as far as I know.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Just saw <a href=""http://www.udk.com/documentation.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a> which again mentions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Can I create any kind of game with UDK?</strong></p>
  
  <p>Absolutely. UDK is the perfect solution for any kind of virtual world you wish to create, from racing games to simulations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So my question is now simply: Would I be able to access the renderer or other functionality of my resulting code to integrate it into an editor for my simulator? I guess a simpler, more relatable analogy would be, if I wrote a game, would I be able to write my own level/character/etc. editor for it? And how would I do so? Yes, I know that the UDK comes with editors already, but I mean if I want to make my own.</p>

<p>Thanks! I appreciate any answers :)</p>

Maybe I will come across some other differences I will have to figure out as well, maybe other people haven't met these problems here (YET) and can profit from the knowledge, and maybe you know some problems/differences that you would have been happy to know about earlier before you spent several hours or days figuring out what the heck is going on.</p>

<p>So here is what I came across.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Simulator is not case sensitive, Devices are case sensitive.</p>

<ul>
<li>This means a default.png or Icon.png will work in simulator, but not on a device where they must be named Default.png and icon.png (if it's still not working read <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2233860/iphone-splash-default-png-displays-on-simulator-but-not-the-iphone/2982007#2982007"">this answer</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Simulator has different codecs to play audio and video</p>

<ul>
<li>If you use f.e. MPMoviePlayerController you might play certain video on the simulator while on the device it won't work
(use Handbrake->presets->iPhone &amp; iPod Touch to create playable videos for Simulator and Device).</li>
<li>If you play audio with AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(&amp;soundID) you might here the sound on simulator but not an a device. (use Audacity to open your soundfile, export as wav and run afconvert -f caff -d LEI16@44100 -c 1 audacity.wav output.caf in terminal)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Also there is this flickering on second run problem which can be resolved with an<br>
playerViewCtrl.initialPlaybackTime = -1.0;<br>
either on the end of playing or before each beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>Simulator is mostly much faster cause it doesn't simulate the hardware but uses Mac resources, therefore f.e. sio2 Apps (OpenGL,OpenAL,etc. framework) run much better on simulator, well everything that uses more resources will run visibly better in simulator than on device.</p></li>

<hr>

<p>I'll start this off by saying that it's not your usual retain/release bug. It just started happening on a development branch of my code, the bug isn't present on the master branch, and I'm having trouble finding any differences in the source that point to the answer. So I'll just get to the gory stuff.</p>

<p>I've got a view controller class. It has a couple of properties on it referencing a couple of other view controllers. Each is loaded via getter accessor as needed, like so:</p>

<pre><code>- (NotesViewController *)notesViewController {
    if (notesViewController == nil) {
        notesViewController = [[NotesViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""NotesViewController"" bundle:nil];
    }
    return notesViewController;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you later on call <code>[self notesViewController]</code>, it's all good. This one, however, just stopped working:</p>

<pre><code>- (DateFieldController *)dateFieldController {
    NSLog(@""made it into the method at least ..."");
    if (dateFieldController == nil) {
        NSLog(@""nib loader, don't let us down..."");
        dateFieldController = [[DateFieldController alloc] initWithNibName:@""DateFieldController"" bundle:nil];
    }
    return dateFieldController;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It would appear that something nasty is happening in the Simulator SDK when firing the nib load method. In fact, possibly way earlier. Over-riding the nib loading initializer with a little NSLog action in the <code>DateFieldController</code> gets us suspiciously nowhere:</p>

<pre><code>- (id)initWithNibName:(NSString *)nibNameOrNil bundle:(NSBundle *)nibBundleOrNil {
    NSLog(@""come on, you..."");
    if ((self = [super initWithNibName:nibNameOrNil bundle:nibBundleOrNil])) 
    {
    NSLog(@""rock on!"");
  }
  return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Suffice to say, neither of these NSLog statements is ever executed.</p>

<p>So what's going on? Why is the runtime blarfing on me? (Switching the call from <code>self.dateFieldController</code> to <code>[self dateFieldController]</code> doesn't fix the bug -- and remember, this code is exactly the same as that on my master branch, where it isn't crashing).</p>

<p>FWIW, I'm building with XCode 3.2.3 64-bit, compiling for Simulator 4.0, Debug, i386 arch (on a new Mac Book Pro running OS X 10.6.3), Deployment Target in Project Settings is set to ""iPhone OS 3.0"" (uppping this to 3.1.3 doesn't fix it either).</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> as requested, the implementation of <code>controllerForFieldType:</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (id)controllerForFieldType:(Type *)type {
    id controller = nil;

    if ([type.mode isEqualToString:@""note""]) {
        controller = self.notesViewController;
    } else if ([type.mode isEqualToString:@""date""]) {
        NSLog(@""going for it, attempting to load dateFieldController from accessor..."");
        controller = self.dateFieldController;
    } else {
        controller = self.fieldViewController;
    }

    return controller;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I left this out earlier because I don't think it's particularly relevant, the problem seems to be happening later in the stack, in the actual getter method <code>dateFieldController</code>.</p>

<p><em>Update II:</em> At @zneak's suggesting, I turned on the setting Run -> Enable Guard Malloc and ran through the scenario again. The results are basically the same, but the internal backtrace in the runtime is different. It would appear that something's wrong with the Class or the NIB that's preventing it from being decoded:</p>

<p><em>Update III:</em> In which the plot thickens. At @ohorob's suggestion in the comments, I added the env arg OBJC_PRINT_INITIALIZE_METHODS=YES and found that every single class initialization in the app looks good except the one in question here. Each looks about like this in the console output:</p>

<pre><code>objc[26750]: INITIALIZE: calling +[UIPinchGestureRecognizer initialize]
objc[26750]: INITIALIZE: finished +[UIPinchGestureRecognizer initialize]
objc[26750]: INITIALIZE: UIPinchGestureRecognizer is fully +initialized
</code></pre>

<p>When I run the app and select the table row that leads to the explosion, we just see the nslog console output before the crash, and the crash itself. I'd like to think this means we could rule out improper initialization, but I'm not enough of an expert on the runtime.</p>

<p>Did a thorough audit of code differences between master branch and this dev branch, and found nothing indicating that I've stepped on a pointer just yet, but I keep thinking that's the mostly likely think that's going on.</p>

3340167,1,"<p>This is a re-post of a topic on the Blackberry Development Forums, but I wasn't getting any answers there, so I thought I would try SO.</p>

<p>I have an in-house library that I developed called Ichabod that is required by one of our applications, Spyder, which runs on the Blackberry 4.5.0 operating system (our original target was for 8330 devices).  I had everything working with bb-ant-tools to compile the library, which is in a separate project, and deploy it to C:\Program Files\eclipse\plugins\net.rim.ejde.componentpack4.5.0_4.5.0.21\components\simulator.  The Spyder application debugged just fine in the eclipse plugin (I am using Galileo with the 1.1.2 version of the RIM plugin). </p>

<p>Today, however, I went to debug the Spyder application after making a couple of changes to the code (no code changes were made in Ichabod), and found that the application couldn't find the Ichabod module all of a sudden.  I noticed that there was now a net.rim.ejde.componentpack4.5.0_4.5.0.28\ directory in my eclipse plugins folder, so thinking that perhaps I updated the component packs without realizing it, I adjusted the target path of the Ichabod library, and rebuilt it with bb-ant-tools.  Same problem.  So, I tried removing the .cod and all associated files from both the 4.5.0.21 and 4.5.0.28 directories, recompiled the Ichabod library to deploy to both locations, and found that it works with 4.5.0.21, but not with 4.5.0.28 (it's not listed in the modules screen under Settings, either). </p>

<p>I have verified that the .cod file is present in the components\simulator folder, but I can't seem to figure out why the simulators don't recognize the file. </p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Here is my question.
I would like to do a 'device texting capability' check on my iPhone simulator before I deploy it to my phone. This is the code I wrote in the .m file.
This is the function which is called when my SMS button is triggered.</p>

<pre><code>    Class messageClass = (NSClassFromString(@""MFMessageComposeViewController""));
 if (messageClass != nil)
 {
   NSLog (@"" \ntxting\n"");
  // We must always check whether the current device is configured for sending messages
  if ([messageClass canSendText] == TRUE)
  {
   NSLog (@""canSendText is not passingg""); //Not entering this loop
   [self displayTextSheet];
  }
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the if-loop does not enter.
I was wondering if the Messageview controller does not pop up in the simulator at all and only for the phone.</p>

<p>Please advice.</p>

<p>Update: I have added a NSLog in the messageClass if loop and that gets printed.
so messageClass is not 'nil'</p>

0,3,"<p>I'm working on a project for multiple mobile phones (iPhone/BlackBerry/Android) in an organization where Wi-Fi is strictly forbidden. The nature of the project employs the phones' camera so simulator programs are not an option, and it needs to be able to communicate to a server, so some form of connectivity is required.</p>

<p>So the problem I have is that I can't use the camera of the phone as well as have it communicate with either my development machine or a QA cluster. I can't get the phone to be on a network wirelessly because of the aforementioned Wi-Fi ban. I can have it communicate over the Internet using 3G or whatever it uses to connect, but then it can't see my local machine or our QA environment because those aren't visible to the outside world. And I can't just use the simulator because I need to use the camera. </p>

<p>The way I see it my only real options are to simulate the communication to the server with ""stunt"" images loaded from files and then test the actual phone-to-server communication when the communication piece goes to production, or do as much testing as I can on some other Wi-Fi network, like the one at my house.</p>

<p>If these phones had Ethernet jacks - or could share the network connection of the machine they're attached to - my problem would be solved. Or if the simulators could use, say, a webcam attached via USB (which would not simulate the capabilities of the actual camera in the phone but might be better than nothing). The fact that different phone platforms have different simulators is unavoidable but complicates the situation further.</p>

5702304,1,"<p>I am currently doing a project for a post-grad agents paper. For my project I have an idea about extending anytime searches such as ARA* ADA* and DLite*. I want to test this idea by simulating it on a robot. I've been looking at different software for the past few nights and have had no luck. </p>

<p>Ultimately I need something that has a robot which will have the following information available at all times and in a discrete fashion:</p>

<p>Coordinates (x,y,z) 
Velocity</p>

<p>I also need the robot to have some way of gathering coordinates from its environment, such as having an IR scanner which will map x,y coordinates with (passable/impassible).</p>

<p>Finally I'll need to be able to program in algorithms which will use the environment information in order to suggest which states to pass through in its path to a goal coordinate.</p>

<p>My question is whether or not there is software which I can achieve all of this without too much effort. I wouldn't want to spend more than 7 nights programming this and Ideally I would like to have some visible results within a night or two.</p>

<p>I have programmed a lot of heuristic search algorithms for my dissertation (i.e. Perimeter search, BiMaxf, BS*, A*, my own bidirectional search algorithm and also some front-to-front searches) All of which have been based on the 8/15-puzzle and can solve reasonably hard problems within a few seconds in Java. I'm comfortable using C languages or scripting ones, as all I'll be needing will be hashtables and priority queues for the ADTs.</p>

<p>So is there any opensource software which I can achieve simulations with (in real time) with reasonable ease. If not, does creating my own simulator sound out of the question? If I were to do that, then it would most likely just be a 2D simulator which <em>knows</em> of its surrounds within a given radius... It would just be nice to do it on something already out there as the experiments wouldn't be (as) biased...</p>

In the view controller, we connect the Description to label. It does display most of information such as lat and long, time.

<p>How we test it？ We use ios simulator that comes with XCODE 4 and connect to 3G internet connection and drive around the town. We can also verify that the information displayed refreshes every minute.</p>

- does Ios Simulator support the Speed display from CoreLocation?
- does corelocation work only on certain type of internet connection? wifi, airport?
- do we have to deploy the app into iphone to get Speed displayed properly?</p>

<p>Update: </p>

<ol>
<li>On looking at Activity Monitor, I see that osascript gets launched from simlauncher before the simulator is launched. Could it be Applescript again? I thought iOS Simulator.app was not scriptable.</li>
<li>iOS Simulator seems to be launched by launchd, so simlauncher is definitely not launching it by itself. Also, simlauncher stays only until the actual application is running in the simulator. They're polling for it perhaps?</li>
<li>For device builds, they're using AMDeviceService, which is probably a version of Apple Mobile Device Service. Is this a technique from the jail broken SDK?</li>

<p>Now I suppose it's just a matter of sorting the commands according to the pid and executing them. :-)</p>

<p>There's a problem, though. All these binaries refer to dylibs present in the simulator platform's root. When I run them directly, they look for those in '/'. </p>

<p>Is there a way to set the path for dylibs before running a command?

0,0,"<p>I know there are stark differences in performance between the iOS simulator running on a desktop and the device.  However, does anyone know what kind of difference this or other settings has on gesture recognition/passing?</p>

<p>I have a few different gestures setup on overlayed UIScrollViews (I know, problems abound) in order to achieve complex paging/scrolling behaviours.  I have single-finger dragging scrolling up and down, and two-finger dragging paging left and right.  My gestures and the interaction between the UIScrollViews is flawless on the iOS simulator.  However, on the device it seems that things like two-finger drags are <em>usually</em> being registered as two single-finger events instead.  About 1 in 10 will work as it should.  I can elaborate on the scrollviews if necessary, but as it works seemingly perfect on the simulator I suspect this to be a simulator vs. device problem.  However I've not found much information on how gestures are recognized and passed, and always assumed something like that would be similar on both devices.</p>

<p>Normally I'd blame error in my fingers' movement in relation to the exactness of the simulator's touch points, but they're not exactly complex gestures...</p>

<p>Thanks for any and all help.</p>

6549779,2,"<p>I'm working on an app that writes data out to a .plist from a view and then pulls it in to populate some UILabels in another view. I've done this several times in the past and it has worked fine on both the device and simulator. This time it's working fine on the simulator but not on the device. I've been through looking at all the connections and code but just can't find why it's not functioning. My suspicion is that for some reason the data is not at the end of the file path, but if it isn't I can't understand why this is the case. </p>

<p>I've Also tried cleaning the targets through the menu and deleting and reinstalling the app on the testing device in the hope that this may rectify the situation, but no joy. </p>

<p>Can anyone offer some insight into why I'm having this problem and how to rectify it? It's why it works on the simulator but not the phone that is confusing me, especially when I've used the same code in the past to make fully functioning apps. I'm using xCode 4 and testing on an iphone 4:</p>

<p>The code is as follows. First I check to see if there is data at the end of a data file path like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSString *)dataFilePath
{
    NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
    NSString *documentsDirctory = [paths objectAtIndex:0];
    return [documentsDirctory stringByAppendingPathComponent:memberDetails];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in viewWillAppear I get the data and use it to populate UIlabels in the View. a Few of the labels are visible or invisible based on the data they contain. The viewWillAppear is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated

{

// Check data file path and if it exists, load data from there. 
    NSString *filePath = [self dataFilePath];
    if ([[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:filePath])

    {
        ///All of the following handles the reloading of data from the plist.
        NSArray *array = [[NSArray alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:filePath];
        memName.text = [array objectAtIndex:0];
        memAddress.text = [array objectAtIndex:1];
        memOccupation.text = [array objectAtIndex:2];
        sherex.text = [array objectAtIndex:3];


        if ([[array objectAtIndex:3] isEqualToString:@""winstonwinston""]) {
            cvName.hidden = NO;
            memName.hidden = NO;
            cvAddress.hidden = NO;
            memAddress.hidden = NO;
            cvOccupation.hidden = NO;
            memOccupation.hidden = NO;
            sherex.hidden = YES;
            altText.hidden = YES;


        } 
        else {
            cvName.hidden = YES;
            memName.hidden = YES;
            cvAddress.hidden = YES;
            memAddress.hidden = YES;
            cvOccupation.hidden = YES;
            memOccupation.hidden = YES;
            sherex.hidden = YES;
            altText.hidden = NO;
        }



        [array release];

    }
    [super viewWillAppear:animated];  
    }
</code></pre>

<p>One thing perhaps worth pointing out is that the if/else statement doesn't seem to be working on the device either. In other words everything in the view is visible. To me this would seem to suggest that the problem might not be the data since if should be able to determine whether or not there is an item called 'winstonwintson' in existence or not and display the hidden/showing elements of the view accordingly.  </p>

0,2,"<p>I have hit yet another iOS simulator bug.   My question is, is there some workaround?</p>

<p>Bug is this:</p>

<p>Load apple's <strong>AurioTouch</strong> sample Project.</p>

<p>and simply print out the number of frames getting received by the <strong>render callback</strong> (in aurioTouchAppDelegate.mm)</p>

<pre><code>static OSStatus PerformThru(
                            void                        *inRefCon, 
                            AudioUnitRenderActionFlags  *ioActionFlags, 
                            const AudioTimeStamp        *inTimeStamp, 
                            UInt32                      inBusNumber, 
                            UInt32                      inNumberFrames, 
                            AudioBufferList             *ioData)
{
    printf( ""%u, "", (unsigned int)inNumberFrames );
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following output: </p>

<pre><code>471, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, ...
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you comment out the call to <strong>AudioUnitRender</strong> on the next line:</p>

<pre><code>{
    printf( ""%u, "", (unsigned int)inNumberFrames );

    aurioTouchAppDelegate *THIS = (aurioTouchAppDelegate *)inRefCon;
    OSStatus err = 0; // AudioUnitRender(THIS-&gt;rioUnit, ioActionFlags, inTimeStamp, 1, inNumberFrames, ioData);
</code></pre>

<p>It now sends an appropriate number of floats each time.</p>

<pre><code>471, 470, 471, 470, 470, 471, 470, 471, 470, 470, 471, 470, 471, 470, 470, 471, 470,
</code></pre>

<p>Another question I have is: why such a random number as 470, 471?   I read somewhere that you specify the buffer length implicitly by specifying its time duration, and it sets the buffer length to <em>the power of two that yields the best approximation to this duration</em>.   But empirical evidence suggests this is not so.</p>

<p>Anyway, pretty sure this is a bug.  I'm going to go on file it.  If anyone can shed some light, please do!</p>

0,1,"<p>I have created a simple iOS program that compiles without a hitch and runs great on an iPad simulator.  The same program cannot be compiled when I tell XCode 4 to use my attached iPad device.  The problem appears to be that several header files cannot be located when I try to use the attached iPad.</p>

<p>Here are the header files that cannot be located on the iPad device (this is excerpted from the relevant include statements):</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/socketvar.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/tcp_fsm.h&gt;

<p>2). sis/sisx for symbian os(s60 v3, s60 v5, s60 uiq, s^2, s^3 etc.)</p>

<p>3). apk for android os(1.6, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.0 etc.)</p>

<p>4). cab/exe for windows mobile(mobile 2003, mobile 5.x, mobile 6.x etc.)</p>

<p>5). ipa for iphone(iphone 3g, 3gs, iphone 4, ipad, ipod etc.)</p>

<p>For jar it would not be such a big problem, as there are some apps like kemulator, microemulator succeed in doing this. For symbian/android, they might be no problem as they are both opensourced. But for windows mobile/iphone, they are big problems as there are no source code to reference, especially for iphone such a proprietary os. </p>

<p>Any suggestions or clues are greatly aprreicated. Thanks. </p>

Even when I open up the ""Game Center""-App on the simulator and click on ""Create Account"" for example I get the error message: ""Game Center account services are currently unavailable. Please try again later.""</p>

<p>I already googled for a few days, here is what I tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I configured my router like Apple says in the documentation, although it did work before the configuations a few weeks ago. I also checked different networks / Routers.</p></li>
<li><p>I completely deleted the XCode Developer tools (the whole /Developer/-Folder) and the iPhone Simulator cahce in <code>~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator</code> and reinstalled everything</p></li>
<li><p>of course I resettet the device plenty of times</p></li>

0,1,"<p>My software development team has recently found itself implementing few different communication protocols for our product to achieve integration with various external products.</p>

<p>Although each protocol was different, the implementation process was very similar. Here are some common things that I've seen:</p>

<ol>
<li>The specific communication protocol was always defined above some standard protocol (UDP, TCP/IP, Serial, CAN) and included a set of messages passing from one side to another. The structure of theses messages was predefined and described by the protocol.</li>
<li>The implementation of this protocol in our product always started from writing C++ header files based on the information provided by the protocol.</li>
<li>In order to allow early integration cycles and properly test our code we always found ourselves developing simulators that implemented our/their side of the protocol.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here comes the question: do you know any tool that could help us to automate / simplify the processes described above?</p>

<p>Ideally I'd like to have a framework that allows me to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define the protocol in some editor / formal language</li>
<li>Export the protocol definition to Doc/PDF in a human-readable format</li>
<li>Export the protocol definition to C++ header files (and probably to other languages)</li>
<li>Based on the protocol definition automatically (or semi-automatically) produce a simulator of both sides in the communication </li>

<p>I am halfway through coding a game app and have just added basic Game Center functionality to my app - it just checks if the user is signed into the Game Center upon startup. If not, it should show a pop-up box prompting the user to either sign in or cancel. When I ran the app in my iPad simulator, I realised it was not doing anything. When I tried running the Game Center app itself in my iPad simulator, I realised that I could not sign in with my usual iTunesconnect account - it just kept hanging. When I tried to ""Create new account"", it said ""Game Center account services are currently unavailable"". However I am able to use the Safari app in the simulator to access the web.</p>

<p>I have an iPad at home which is connected to the internet via the same router (so it cannot be a firewall config problem) which is always on Game Center. When I got the error message on my simulator, I checked the connection on my iPad and I was still logged into the Game Center. When I tried signing out, I could sign in again immediately without any problems. So I tried testing my app in my iPad instead - I got xCode to build the app in my iPad. When I ran the app, it popped up the pop-up box, saying it was using a Sandbox account, and prompted me to sign in with my itunesConnnect account so I did so, but nothing else happened - however I had not programmed any further Game Center functionality into the app. When I quit my app and tried running the Game Center app from my iPad, it started behaving like the iPad simulator -- it would hang when I tried to sign in with my iTunesconnect account, and when I tried to create a new account instead, it would tell me that the services were currently unavailable... when barely 10 mins before, before I installed and ran my app, everything was working OK. </p>

<p>Could I have hosed some settings in my iPad Game Center and now it won't work?? I do not understand how installing my app could have affected the Game Center app in any way. Now both my iPad device and my simulator will not sign into Game Center. </p>

<p>PS: I have checked my /etc/hosts file etc. on my computer and it is the default file, it cannot be a problem with my firewall because I was always able to access Game Center on my iPad before this. Does anyone have any ideas? This is driving me crazy and I wonder if I have to resort to clicking ""Restore"" on my Ipad to bring the Game Center back. But it still won't solve the problem with the simulator on my Mac not working.</p>

Trying to compile and run it with new Xcode 4.2 using iPhone 5 Simulator, MPMoviePlayerController is not sending notifications when I load a movie. Looks like it fails to properly detect the video file.
The code looks more or less like that (simplified code):</p>

<pre><code>// First I'm initializing the player with a URL from a file
MPMoviePlayerController *player;
player = [[MPMoviePlayerController alloc] init];
player.shouldAutoplay = NO;
NSURL *url = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:path];
player.contentURL = url;

// Then I'm adding an observer in order to wait for the player to find movie duration
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(durationAvailable:)

<p>After the above, I'm waiting in a loop for the notification to get called, by waiting for about 10 seconds, during which I'm calling the run loop.
Using the same code, same Xcode 4.2 version, but with iPhone 4.3 Simulator, after about a second the notification gets called, and I can read the player duration. However, when running the exact same code on iPhone 5 Simulator, the notification function never gets called, and if I try to read the movie duration afterwards it contains 0.</p>

<p>One more thing which seems to be important: when underlying EAGLView is hidden then it does not occur. GLView and Popover do not share any data - interesting, is not it? I suspect it comes when pressed button (""edit"") wants to redraw/toggle to ""blue"" then some blending happens since popover heading is a kind of translucent.

8025398,2,"<p>I'm creating a Boolean logic simulator.  I've posted a question regarding the organization and general setup of the application and it's located here: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7936152/organizing-simple-boolean-logic-simulator-java"">Organizing Simple Boolean Logic Simulator - Java</a>.  I figured this doesn't apply directly to the other question so it would be OK posting this separately.  Please excuse my code, I'm very new to Java.</p>

<p>The organization of the code is actually quite simple, but I've run into a problem when I try to assign a variable to itself in an assign statement.</p>

<p>For example, we'll commonly use statements like this:</p>

<pre><code>assign input1 * input2 + test3 * input2 to test3;
</code></pre>

<p>When input1 and input2 are high, test3 will become high.  At that point, input1 could drop out and test3 would still be high because it refers to itself in the statement. (Note: * => AND, + => OR)  As you can see below, I'm having problems when a variable refers to itself in its assign statement like above.  That's because when I attempt to get the value of the statement above I'm getting:</p>

<p>input1 * input2 + (input1 * input2 + (input1 * input2 + test3 * input2) * input2) * input2</p>

<p>Etc.  It just attempts to evaluate its statement over and over again.</p>

<pre><code>public interface Argument {
    public boolean evaluate();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the ""Bit"" class that stores information about each bit.  The bit can either be a ""hard-wired"" true or false, or it can have a statement assigned to it.</p>

<pre><code>public class Bit implements Argument {

    private String name;
    private boolean value;
    private Argument assign;
    private boolean assigned;

    Bit( String name, boolean value ) {

    public OrOperation( Argument arg1, Argument arg2 ) {
        this.argument1 = arg1;
        this.argument2 = arg2;

    }

}

<p>Parser class:  I've only included part of this, since the actually parsing isn't all that relevant.  <strong>Note that when I assign a variable to itself the error is produced.</strong>  In the second test below, I assigned test3 to test3.  I can infer that this is because test3 attempts to determine the value of itself, calling that second statement over and over again.</p>

<pre><code>public class Parser {

    public HashMap&lt;String, Bit&gt; bits = new HashMap&lt;String, Bit&gt;();

    Parser(String file) {

        bits.put( ""test1"", new Bit( ""test1"", true ) );
        bits.put( ""test2"", new Bit( ""test2"", true ) );
        bits.put( ""test3"", new Bit( ""test3"", false ) );
        bits.put( ""test4"", new Bit( ""test4"", true ) );

        // Works great
        bits.get(""test3"").setAssign( parseStatement(""test1 * ~test2 + test4 * test2"") );
        System.out.println( bits.get(""test3"").evaluate() );

        // Produces error
        bits.get(""test3"").setAssign( parseStatement(""test1 * test2 + test3 * test2"") );
        System.out.println( bits.get(""test3"").evaluate() );

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The parser basically creates the statements like so: (taken from previous question)</p>

<pre><code>Operand op = new AndOperand( register1, new OrOperand( register2, register3 );
boolean output = op.evaluate(); // this is register1 &amp;&amp; (register2 || register3 )
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully this was clear enough.  Let me know if there's any question as to what the problem is or what I'm trying to do.  Thanks in advance.</p>

I was able to get it up to 640x480 by editing the QEMU source but as I could not get any examples to work, so I don't know if it works either. Using the debug parameters for SSD0323, all I can see is that it accepts some of the data that is sent to initialize the device, then hangs...</p>

<p>I have searched high and low for an answer to this problem but just have not found a solution.</p>

<p>Basically I have made an app that works just fine when run from an actual iphone (3GS and 4) but it will not run in the iphone simulator.</p>

<p>When I try to run it through the sim it gives me two warnings and one error.</p>

<p>The warnings are that it is ignoring AVFoundationFramework and CoreFoundationFramework. It says that it is missing the required architecture i386 in file for architecture i386. - To me this is saying that these files are not supported for a intel cpu - is that correct?</p>

This runs flawlessly on the iPad simulator, but for some reason, it crashed after trying to edit the data on the iPhone simulator. I thought this is probably an issue with putting the applicationDidEnterBackground: in the view controller, but if that was the issue, then wouldn't it crash on the iPad simulator as well?</p>

<p>I know that I should put applicationDidEnterBackground in the app delegate, but my method looks sort of like this:</p>

    [array addObject:firstField.text];
    [array addObject:secondField.text];

    [array writeToFile:[self dataFilePath] atomically:YES];

<p>If I put this in the App Delegate, of course it doesn't recognize firstField or secondField because I did not declare it in header file or synthesize it or anything. If I were to declare everything in the App Delegate, then the outlets in my nib file will fail because each of the File's Owner's class is one of those specific view controllers. </p>

<p>Is the placement of applicationDidEnterBackground: not even my issue since it runs fine on the iPad simulator?
Also, it used to run fine on the iPhone simulator as well. I changed the Image View's background on all of the nibs, then this started happening. I rechecked all my outlets and actions and they match up fine.</p>

<p>EDIT: I fixed it. Turns out I had an extra field that I decided to add to the iPad's nib, but not the iPhone's. I though it would be fine, not the case though. That explains all the weirdness that was going on. I deleted the field in the iPad's nib and everything is A Okay.

I'm currently trying to implement an 8086 ASM debugger for learning purposes. Until now, I tried to simulate the 8 and 16 bit registers with char arrays but this approach is driving me nuts, when working with AX, AL and AH.</p>

<pre><code>#define setAL() { int i; for (i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++) AL[i] = AX[i]; }
char AX[16]   = {0, 1, 1, 1, 1 ,1 ,1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
char AL[8]    = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone has any good idea (or something like 'best practice') how to simulate those registers?</p>

<p>EQUIPMENT: Mac Mini (2011) , running OSXLion (10.7) , 8gb ram, 500gb hd
XCODE: version 4.2, running IPAD 4.3 and 5.0 simulators</p>

<p>I have developed an Ipad app using the program HYPE (html 5 designer/generator), this program was developed by an APPLE team. I then brought it into Xcode using the PhoneGap template. I had developed this app in a previous version of Xcode (4.0 using MAC osx snow leopard) and was able to transfer everything into Xcode 4.2 (including the phonegap template) successfully.</p>

<p>All was running fine. I launched my app in the app store successfully (Five Element Clinic Book HD - <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/five-element-clinic-book-hd/id495512918?alreadyRedirected=1&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D2&amp;mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/five-element-clinic-book-hd/id495512918?alreadyRedirected=1&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D2&amp;mt=8</a>)</p>

<p>I noticed some issues I wanted to change (namely the external hosting was not working - my embeded youtube video (iframe) was not working, links to external websites not working and an iframe bringing in a counter script (javascript) also not showing - so I decided to take a look at everything to see if I adding more detailed URLs in the phonegap.plist external hosts area would work.</p>

<p>I didn't even get that far. When I opened Xcode again (after about 2 weeks, so there must have been some kind of API change) - I had a tone of errors that lead me to the information of needing to Convert my files over to Objective C ARC.</p>

<p>So I did this, with no errors or issues. Everything converted seamlessly. All files are showing converted to Objective C ARC.</p>

<p>I CLEANED then reBUILT - with absolutely no errors or warnings - and RAN my app in the IPAD simulator (4.3 and 5.0). </p>

<p>This is what happens. The simulator opens, my app launches, the start up screen shows, the app begins to load the rest of the app and just goes to a WHITE SCREEN. Forever. It goes no where else.</p>

<p>So I have quit the app, restarted the app, deleted the app, tried everything again. Same issue. If I quit the app it just goes to a black screen. I have also restarted Xcode and my computer, ran my disk warriors to fix file permissions, etc.</p>

<p>I still have my old project in my old laptop (Xcode 4.0, MAC OSx Snow Leopard). So I went back there to see if I could just work from the old environment. Nope. Same errors that require me to convert files to Objective C ARC. So I converted with zero issues and zero errors. Cleaned, Built - no errors) and ran the program in the simulators. None of them work, everything loads the start-up screen and goes to a white page.</p>

<p>Does ANYONE know what is going on?</p>

<p>And thank you. </p>

0,1,"<p>I have wrote myself a very strong protection class ""BlockIp"" that can use a blacklist with ip's and can detect strange IP configuration's and can block proxies. When it found one, i get a detailed email about the visitor and why it is blocked and what they want to try to do (once a day of course). It seems that it is working very well because i received some real attacks in the past that have been blocked by this class. It does not block legal bots, but that is not easy to test that the detection method is correct. </p>

<p>Today i get an email from the class that it has blocked ""ycar10.mobile.bf1.yahoo.com"", it identifies itself as a yahoo robot but was behind a proxy. I search the net if it was blacklisted but didn't found that it is blacklisted. So the question is: Is it right to block bots behind a proxy (use legal bots proxy's anyway?)? Here some information about the bot:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP_ACCEPT = */*
HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR = 107.38.3.137,  98.137.88.60
HTTP_USER_AGENT = YahooCacheSystem
PATH = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
SERVER_SIGNATURE = 
SERVER_SOFTWARE = Apache/2.2.14
SERVER_PORT = 80
REMOTE_ADDR = 98.139.241.249
REMOTE_PORT = 53863
GATEWAY_INTERFACE = CGI/1.1
SERVER_PROTOCOL = HTTP/1.1
REQUEST_METHOD = GET
QUERY_STRING = 
REQUEST_URI = /
SCRIPT_NAME = /index.php
PHP_SELF = /index.php
REQUEST_TIME = 1330923844   
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, is there a test case (suite/simulator) to be able to the test the correct behaviour of a legal bot (only allowing the major ones such as: Google, Yahoo, Bing), to be sure i used the right detection method. There are some simulators around, but most of them are not working properly and the next question is: ""can i trust it..."".</p>

<p>*Notice: As you can see in the details above, it is using a REMOTE_PORT value of 53863, what kind of port is 53863?*</p>

<p>I hope you can understand my question, if not, drop a line here.</p>

<p>First line: (# of cpus) (# of processes) (quantum size)</p>

<p>Process line: (ID) (Priority) (time of submission) (cpu time required) (compute time before I/O is needed) (I/O time for each compute)</p>

<p>More Process Lines needed based on how many processes are defined from the first line.</p>

<p>example input may be:</p>

<p>1 1 10</p>

<p>1 1 0 20 5 50</p>

<p>Long story short, can anyone point me to some resources that will help or sample source that include a possibility of multiple CPUs. Or if you guys can even help me get started I would really really appreciate it. I'm not asking for you to make the whole thing, just help get me started so I will know where to go from there.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Yeah, super primitive and not efficient, but it reads all the numbers and ends at either EOF or when anything not a digit comes it's way. Also a negative number. The reason I made proc an array of 25 is because that is the limit our instructor said the number will go up too. And with CPUs, he said a max of four will be used, so I just made an array, mainly because I'm terrible with pointers.</p>

<p>Now that I have the data into my array(s), I need to sort through my proc array by subTime and get started with the actual calculations. How bad will this part be, especially with my lousy set up?</p>

<p>I have tried to set ki and hi to 0 but if I do that then mi is also set to 0 and then no mouse moves but the screen is still put to sleep! :$</p>

   input.type = INPUT_MOUSE;
   input.mi = mouse;

   SendInput(1, &amp;input, sizeof (input));

11003468,4,"<p>Here is a video with logging the index path in cell for row at index path: (see new link below)</p>

<p>So, another weird one... 
On my home iMac (brand new), when I run an Xcode project in the simulator for the first time, it runs fine.  If I then quit out of the simulator and Xcode and then open up Xcode again and run it - (think of this as starting to work on the project again another day) - When I attempt to scroll any uitableview, the simulator redraws ALL the cells (it doesn't seem to dequeue and reuse correctly). I know this because I am running NSLog when the cell is being drawn.</p>

<p>If I reset the setting in the simulator and then run it again - it scrolls smoothly.
I've tried completely uninstalling Xcode and reinstalling it to no avail.
I'm using Xcode 4.3.2.</p>

<p>Now, one might assume that this is something with the code BUT, get this:
I have another (brand new iMac) at the office. I have this Xcode project on dropbox so both copies are the same (office and home).  In the office, I do NOT have this weird scrolling problem... everything works correctly.</p>

<p>The only difference between the two macs (both are 27 inch and have 16gb RAM) is the hdd -
The office mac has a 1tb 7200 RPM drive. My home mac has an SSD from Apple.</p>

<p>I have no clue what could be causing this... It's REALLY frustrating.
I'm not against wiping my home mac and starting over but that's a bit drastic.</p>

<p>Thoughts?  I didn't post code because running the same code on 2 different computers yields different results, so the code doesn't seem to be the issue.</p>

<p>Note:  I upgraded to Lion from Snow Leopard so that I could run Xcode 4.3.2.  This was a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I found a work-around. I should have clarified that I was running in iPad mode with the simulator. I switched to iPhone mode and was able to add a contact with no problems. I then switched back to iPad so that I could continue development. My app is a universal app and has no problems accessing contacts within SDK code. I conclude at the moment that there is either a bug with the simulator with contacts or something got bugged some how. Anyway, I am up and running again. The next step is to update to the latest Xcode 4.3.3. However, I do not want to do so during heavy development. I will update when I am able to.</p>

0,2,"<p>Before I start, I need to stress the fact that I have looked at every post dealing with the documents directory. </p>

<p>So I will try to disect my problem to better help you help me.</p>

<p>I am developing an iOS application targeted for 5.1. I am using XCode  4.4.1 and the iOS simulator Version 5.1 (272.21).</p>

<p>It is in my understanding that when an app is installed in the simulator, its directory structure is mapped under </p>

<pre><code>/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/[IOS_VERSION]/Applications/[APP_UUID]
</code></pre>

<p>This is properly reflected when I run my application.</p>

<p>Furthermore I am able to successfully create and use a temporary directory using the following code </p>

<pre><code>NSString *tmpDir = NSTemporaryDirectory();
</code></pre>

<p>which results in the following path</p>

<pre><code>/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/[IOS_VERSION]/Applications/[APP_UUID]/tmp
</code></pre>

<p>The problem starts appearing when I want to work with the <strong>Documents</strong> directory that is supposed to be in </p>

<pre><code>/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/[IOS_VERSION]/Applications/[APP_UUID]/Documents
</code></pre>

<p>The following code checks for the existence of that path, and then logs it using NSLog, and even though it says it exists navigating to that location returns a file not found.</p>

<pre><code>+ (NSString *) currentPath{

NSArray *searchPaths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
NSString *documentPath = [searchPaths objectAtIndex:0];

searchPaths=nil;

BOOL fileExists = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath:documentPath];

if (fileExists == TRUE) {
    NSLog(@"" %@ already exists"",documentPath);
} else {

    NSLog(@""doesn't exists"");
    NSFileManager *fileManager = [NSFileManager defaultManager];
    NSError *error;

    if(![fileManager createDirectoryAtPath:documentPath withIntermediateDirectories:true attributes:nil error:&amp;error])
    {
        NSLog(@""Couldn't create documents directory %@"",error);

    }



}

return documentPath;

0,1,"<p>Firstly I will explain my problem with trying to an support ios4+ app on Xcode 4.4.1, then I have 3 questions below, I appreciate any answers that may help me.</p>

<p>I have happily used various versions of Xcode for a while and recently upgraded to Xcode 4.4.1 and ML. In the past it has always been possible to copy in the older simulator sdks to the relevant folder in the Xcode package contents, this technique no longer works.</p>

<p>The advertisement for Xcode 4.4.1 reads with this extract:</p>

<p>""Xcode includes a new 'Downloads' preference pane to install optional components such as command line tools, and previous iOS Simulators""</p>

<p>This convinced me that I would be able to get old simulators to work, but in my experience this far, you can only get one singular old simulator (ios 5.0). The extract above would indicate you could get access to more than one old simulator as it uses the plural ""previous ios simulators"".</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>You may also get the option to download ios4.3 simulator if you have updated to Xcode 4.4.1 before installing Mountain Lion. However the simulator will not work once you have ML and 4.4.1.</p>

<p><strong>END EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I have been able to test using a personal device (iphone) running ios4.3 but this is not an ideal way for me to test. I support down to ios4.0 so ideally like to check my code with ios simulators for ios4.0, ios4.1, ios4.2, and ios4.3.</p>

<p>I like to use the latest Xcode and ML but it seems my best option may be to roll back to an older Xcode on Lion.</p>

<p>Questions</p>

<p>1) Is there any way to get functional ios4 simulators on Xcode 4.4.1 Mountain Lion?</p>

<p>2) Are there any plans to allow ios4 simulators in a new version or have Apple deliberately blocked this?</p>

<p>3) Are there other developers in this position, that can advise what is the best measure? Are people holding off / rolling back from Xcode 4.4.1 on ML?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>SECOND EDIT - My Work Around Solution</strong></p>

<p>As I have had it confirmed ios4 simulators are not supported on Xcode 4.4.1 (ML) and the advice is you should test on a device.</p>

<p>I decided I still needed a version of lion with xcode 4.3.3 on it somewhere so I could access ios 4 simulators. Therefore on my imac I set up a virtual machine via vmware that run osx 10.7 lion. On this virtual machine I installed Xcode 4.3.3 and the old simulators now I have them available for when I want to test any ios4 issues :).</p>

<p>This solution has cost me 28gb in memory space on my imac but Im happy I have mountain lion running on my main machine and a virtual machine with lion running and xcode 4.3.3. It may seem like a lot of trouble but what are the other options?</p>

<p>Another solution is maybe ask the user Popeye how he is claiming to have done it. I have tried to find out but not got anything apart from irrelevant information and requests to delete the question. </p>

<p>I asked this before, but didnt attach code and never got an answer and am getting desperate lol.
If this is a repost, I apologize, but I have been scouring the net and cant seem to find anything that works. I have a list of workouts that I display in a tableview that are gathered in plists in the bundle. There is a also a separate tab that I have that allows a user to build their own workouts and save them in the documents folder plist file. Once they are saved, they are added to the table view. In the simulator, everyuhting works fine. But on the actual device, it is not updated unless I close the program for an extended period of time, reload the program from xcode, or turn the phone off. I have tried adding [[self tableview] reload] to ""viewDidLoad"", ""viewWillappear"", and ""viewDidAppear"" and none of them work. Once again, the file is saved, the updating does work in the simulator, and it doesn't update in the phone right away. Any suggestions? Thanks.</p>

<p>The point of the program is to make a simulator - like the one in the link. I want to keep it realistic and use Python. I want to draw the simulation in <a href=""http://pygame.org"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""Pygame website"">Pygame</a>.</p>

<p>In my program I ask for a couple of variables; the mass and the radius. The radius will be used to calculate the volume of a sphere and the mass will be used to calculate the buoyancy, gravity force and acceleration. </p>

<p>But the thing is, to keep everything in SI-units I ask for the radius in metre. Doing this while keeping my radius under 10cm, makes for a really small number. And when I use the Pygame module to draw a sphere at the size of 0.1m, it fails. So instead of doing that, I needed to use a bigger scale.</p>

<p>So here comes my main problem. How exacly should I scale the sphere? Say I wanted to define 100 pixels to be 1 metre. I would then have to multiply my radius by 100, since that would be the scale, but now that the sphere is bigger should the velocity also be multiplied by 100?</p>

<p>I've gotten really confused over this! Thanks for your time.</p>

My code is below:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)populateUserDetails {
    if (FBSession.activeSession.isOpen) {
        [[FBRequest requestForMe] startWithCompletionHandler:
         ^(FBRequestConnection *connection, NSDictionary&lt;FBGraphUser&gt; *user, NSError *error) {
             if (!error) {
                NSLog(@""logged in"");
             } else {
                 NSLog(@""error: %@"", error);
             }
         }];
    } else {
       NSLog(@""no active session"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using breakpoints, I determined that the activeSession is always open, so the startWithCompletionHandler: method is actually called. Maybe it's a build problem since it runs fine on the Simulator? Any ideas?</p>

13390594,7,"<p>Frequently, when I try to delete an app on the iOS 6 simulator that comes with Xcode 4.5, the simulator freezes. What I do is just long press on the app. Delete dialog doesn't come up and the icons keep on wiggling. Quitting and re-opening the simulator does not help to delete the app. </p>

<p>I've tried to delete the app's folder from /Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/5.1/Applications folder. Sometimes this helps but sometimes even this doesn't delete the icon from the simulator. </p>

<p>This behavior is independent of the iOS version or the device model. It's the same whichever model/iOS I choose. </p>

<p>The only thing that helps is using the Reset Contents and Settings option of the simulator. </p>

0,2,"<p>I'm wanting to test out my app with the iPhone 5 resolution, so I'm using the simulator. My app has Portrait and 2 landscape orientations in Supported Device Orientations, and the viewControllers which allow rotation have <code>shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation</code> set to YES. Yet when I rotate the device in the simulator, it doesn't rotate as it does on the device. Right now i'm just using the standard iPhone 4 simulator.</p>

<p>Edit: This is the code I have for setting my VC.</p>

<pre><code>UIViewController *vc = [[UIViewController alloc] init];
    self.navigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:vc];
self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
    [self.window addSubview:self.navigationController.view];

self.loadingWood = [[UIImageView alloc] init];
[vc.view addSubview:self.loadingWood];
</code></pre>

<p>And then shortly after:</p>

<pre><code>self.timeline = [[JTimelineViewController alloc] init];
[self.navigationController setViewControllers:[NSArray arrayWithObject:self.timeline]];
</code></pre>

<p>This is necessary for visuals when the app starts up.</p>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<p>I now have this working. The problem I now face is that despite one of my viewControllers stating this, it still rotates upon any rotation on the iPhone Simulator:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation
{
    return (interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait);

}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT 3: My phone is running iOS5. The simulator is running iOS6. This is a possible reason. Removing Landscape Left and Landscape Right as supported orientations means no simulator rotation at all, but my iOS5 iPhone 4 continues to rotate as normal.</p>

12743207,3,"<p>I am running a C program using GCC and a proprietary DSP cross-compiler to simulate some functioality. I am using the following code to measure the execution time of particular part of my program:</p>

<pre><code>clock_t start,end;
printf(""DECODING DATA:\n"");
start=clock();
conv3_dec(encoded, decoded,3*length,0);
end=clock();
duration = (double)(end - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
printf(""DECODING TIME = %f\n"",duration);
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>conv3_dec()</code> is a function defined in my program and I want to find the run-time of this function.</p>

<p>Now the thing is when my program runs, the <code>conv3_dec()</code> functions runs for almost 2 hours but the output from the <code>printf(""DECODING TIME = %f\n"",duration)</code> says that the execution of the function finished in just half a second (<code>DECODING TIME = 0.455443</code>) . This is very confusing for me.</p>

<p>I have used the <code>clock_t</code> technique to measure the runtimes of programs previously but the difference has never been so huge. Is this being caused by the cross-compiler. Just as a side note, the simulator simulates a DSP processor running at just 500MHz, so is the difference in the clock speeds of the DSP processor and my CPU causing the error is measuring the CLOCKS_PER_SEC. </p>

<p>In other words:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Simulator</code> Thread
<ul>
<li>Read file, create event when timestamp occurs</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Worker</code> thread
<ul>
<li>Process data (this is the code will remain when we go to production)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Event handoff / <code>Notifier</code> thread??? (See below)</li>
</ol>

<p>I am trying to figure out how best to implement <code>Simulator</code>. It seems wrong to me to read one line at a time, and then sleep the number of milliseconds until that event occurs. Some events are less than 10 ms apart. What I'd like to do is have an event queue so that I can get ahead when events are far apart, so that I have minimal processing to do when they are near each other.</p>

<p>Perhaps <code>Simulator</code> should really be 2 threads, one that reads the file and puts events in the queue, and one that handles them and fires off events to the work thread (see above, <code>Notifier</code> thread). Does that sound reasonable? Below is some code that outlines what I'm thinking. Am I on the right track? Not included here is the thread that reads the file and creates <code>MyEvent</code>s.</p>

0,1,"<p>I am using SMPPSim selenium software and i have connected it to the kannel 4.3 , am sending messages using the SMPPSim from the user interface using inject message</p>

<p>I have noticed that if i send long messages from SMPPSim to kannel , I wont receive those long messages and the udh=0 always either for short messages or long messages(multiple messages)</p>

<p>as i know long messages should be divided into multiple messages and their udh should be value other then 0</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that :
1. I have been asked to use kannel 1.4.3 by the requested client , requested client is still using 1.4.3 and they have so many applications based in this version of the kannel so upgrading is not in my hand.
2. It is mentioned in SMPPSim selenium software that it supports multiple messages but how i really dont know , and that what am looking for !!!</p>

13413524,4,"<p>At school we started multithreading last week and we already are on multiprocessing now, I am getting a little lost on it so I am going to explain the problem to you.
For an exercise we must make a casino game simulator which simulates 10000 games so that we can know how often the casino wins the game.
So I coded the simulator, and I've got 5 methods to run a game :</p>

<pre><code>static void game(Croupier croupier)
{
    croupier.createNewCardDeck();
    croupier.shuffleCards();
    croupier.giveCardsToPlayers();
    croupier.countPlayerPoints();
    croupier.displayResults();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I call game in a classic for loop of 10000 iterations it runs ok, takes approx 2 seconds, and the bank wins 50% of times.</p>

<p>If I use Parallel.For, it crashes on shuffleCards, because (I think) multiple processes are trying to edit the same pack of cards at the same time.</p>

<p>My first idea was to put a Mutex on my shuffleCards, but it would slow down the simulation, when the point of using Parallel programming was to increase speed. So I thought to separate data on the different processes ( so that instead of 10000 iterations, I do 2500 on 4 processes, every loop having its own croupier, players, cards etc...)</p>

<p>What do you think would be the best way of resolving this problem ? Have you got any simple tutorial that explains how to deal with parallel work which uses the same data ? Which solution would you choose ?
Thanks</p>

<p>Edit : ShuffleCard method</p>

<pre><code>        List&lt;Card&gt; randomList = new List&lt;Card&gt;();

        Random r = new Random();
        int randomIndex = 0;

        while (_cards.Count &gt; 0)
        {
            randomIndex = r.Next(0, _cards.Count); //Choose a random object in the list
            randomList.Add(_cards[randomIndex]); //add it to the new, random list
            _cards.RemoveAt(randomIndex); //remove to avoid duplicates
        }
        return randomList;
</code></pre>

<p>So yes _cards being a private property of croupier (which calls this._cards = shuffleCards() , every process have the same card list</p>

<p>So I had the thought that maybe the problem was that I started with iPad and created the iPhone interface later (although the project itself was generic from the start).</p>

<p>I copied the gesture recognizers (tap and two swipes) from the storyboard for the iPad and pasted them into the storyboard for the iPhone. I didn't think this was going to work, but I was hopeful that's all I would have to do. In any case, it seems like the same code should be able to be linked from both storyborad gesture recognizers.</p>

<p>When that didn't work, I hooked up the iPhone gesture recognizers using Control-drag just like I did with the iPad. This created new methods. Since the same code could be used, I thought I'd simply call the other:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)tapIphone:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)sender {
   [self tapIpad:sender];
}
- (IBAction)tapIpad:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)sender {
</code></pre>

<p>omitted code</p>

<pre><code>}
</code></pre>

<p>That didn't work either. So next I tried copy/pasting the code from the iPad method to the iPhone method. It still didn't work.</p>

<p>So now I'm wondering if maybe I don't know how to test taps properly on the iPhone simulator. What else could I have missed?</p>

14249665,1,"<p>I am following the course on iOS through iTunes university and working on the calculator project.  I moved the controls on the storyboard to make room for another control at the top.  Everything looks fine on the storyboard but when run in the simulator, controls are bunch up, on top of each other, and some are clearly off the top of the simulator screen.  This leads to the following very related questions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How does one move controls around on the storyboard?  I went to the size inspector of each control (buttons in my case) and changed the 'Y' value (increased it by 10).  I did this for each control.  I didn't think about it as I was doing it because as I said, all looks fine on the storyboard. Is there a better way to move controls around?  I could not figure out how to grab more than one control at a time and move them.  Grabbing all and moving or all but one and moving would have been ideal.</p></li>
<li><p>I anticipate someone is going to say, ""We need more info. "" How do I show the storyboard?  Is there a xml file somewhere?  How is the storyboard saved?  How should I show the results of the simulator?</p></li>

<p>Changing VALID_ARCHS to:
VALID_ARCHS = ""$(ARCHS_STANDARD_32_BIT)"";(which expands to armv7 and armv7a)

VALID_ARCHS = armv7 i386
Seemed to have satisfied xcodebuild enough to agree to build for simulator. Mind you, the first case still doesn't list i386! And I must conclude i386 becomes, in certain conditions, implicit. Can anyone confirm and/or expand on any of this?</p>

<p>The problem I'm facing is that when I run the project I get and error from the simulator: ""iOS Simulator could not find the SDK. The SDK may need to be reinstalled.""</p>

<p>And if I try to change the version from the simulator there is no 4.3 option:

<p>My assignment requires me to run the sim 10,000,000 times. </p>

<p>None of that is an issue; I have the sim made and I know how to run in and I know how to create the required variables.</p>

<p>What I'm unsure of, is how I should go about storing the results of each game?</p>

<p>What I need to find in the end is:</p>

<p>Average # of Rolls Per Game
Max # of Rolls in a game
number of games that needed more than 30 rolls
number of wins
number of losses
probability of a win
longest sequence of wins and longest sequence of losses</p>

<p>All easy enough, I'm just not sure how to store 10,000,000 numbers and then access them easily.</p>

<p>For example the first: 
Average number of rolls
should I create an arraylist that has 10,000,000 items in it? add one item at the end of each game and then add them all up and divide by 10,000,000?</p>

<p>I realize this should work, I'm just wondering if there is another way, or perhaps a better (more efficient) way.</p>

<p>New part to this question:
Can I return more than one value from a method? Currently the simulation runs 10,000,000 times and returns a win or loss from each time. But I also need it to return the number of rolls from each game... Otherwise I can't figure out the values for avg rolls and highest number of rolls and number of games over 30 rolls. </p>

<p>Any ideas here?</p>

end
</code></pre>

<p>the vector rollers(2).ink is the vector i'd like to update. currently the vector is populated only once so i have ones from row 98:103. I would like this range of elements to be populated for each 'rotation' of my system not just the first time.
The reason - I'm trying to show ink being added intermittently from only a small section of the roller surface, hence the need for only five cells to be populated.
i thought that if i iterated from 1 to the number of timesteps, in steps size nBins-Max in the loop:</p>

<pre><code>for tt = 1:nBins_max:nTimeSteps
</code></pre>

<p>this doesn't seem to be what i'm after.
I'm also hoping to remove ink from the system at the end. for every revolution i would like to be able to remove a percentage of ink on each rotation so it does not stay in the system (as if it was being printed onto a sheet and taken away).
Hopefully someone can understand this and perhaps offer some advice on how to proceed on either or both of my issues.</p>

16223126,1,"<p>I noticed that the simulator in VS2012 is (apparently) opening a new Windows session with the same account, which causes many issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can't use the Modern UI version of IE, because IE is not my default browser. But if I set it as the default browser in the simulator, it also becomes the default browser in my host session, which I don't want</li>
<li>for apps that are scheduled to start when the session starts, a new instance is started in the simulator. For instance:
<ul>
<li>Dropbox: it could probably cause serious issues if both instances try to synchronize the same physical folder</li>
<li>Spark: it detects that someone else connected with the same account from another computer, so I'm disconnected in the host session</li>
<li>Logitech Setpoint: it captures the mouse wheel in the simulator, which means I can't use the wheel any more in the host session (I have to kill Setpoint in the simulator to fix it)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems to me that the best way to fix this problem would be to have the simulator open a session with a different user account, so that it doesn't interfere with my current session. But I couldn't find any option to control the behavior of the simulator... Is it possible at all?</p>

<p>I was wondering if I should make member functions of simulation_engine static, because objects own independent events list and share the same clock,  and might happen a synchronization problem. </p>

<p>What should I do?</p>

I hope your answer, thank you in advance.</p>

0,2,"<p>I'm a beginning computer science student and we've been asked to complete a project that animates random generated car objects moving to randomly generated parking spots on a city map grid. I've developed a GUI for the buttons, text fields, and text areas. Everything works as required except for at the end of the animation, when all cars have reached parking spots, I need to display analytics in my JTextArea. My buttons are set up properly and I will show you where the code takes place below:</p>

<pre><code>    else if (e.getSource() == start) {

    setAnimate(true);

    if(simulator.simulationFinished()) {
        createAnalytics();
    }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>So here I have implemented an action listener on the button ""start"" that begins the animation. Currently it:</p>

<ol>
<li>currently it begins the animation and all the cars travel to the parking spots as intended.</li>
<li>it displays analytics that are derived from before the animation began (Analytics include: car ID, number of moves, average number of spots tried, average distance travelled)</li>
<li>then the animation will conclude.</li>
<li>If I press the start button again it will display the proper analytics.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know that in order for the program to display the right analytics the moment the program finishes I most likely need a while loop, however I haven't been able to dream anything up that will not create an infinite loop and require me to manually terminate the program via console.</p>

<pre><code>    while(!simulator.simulationFinished()) {
    if(simulator.simulationFinished() == true)break; {
    createAnalytics();
    }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried this among several hundred other variations of all the loops in existence. Following from my logic, I need the while loop so that it will keep checking to see if the simulation is finished so that I can execute my method that generates analytics, but if don't give the while loop something to do it just goes on forever and crashes. I'm at a loss, any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

16556569,1,"<p>Okay, so this is a parking ticket application... I'm sure you've all seen/done them before. This one is for C++ and I'm having trouble with getting my class-contained methods to access private members of a friend class. I know that this is completely a syntax error, but I can't seem to find an example that makes sense to me on what the syntax actually is.</p>

<p>This is (one of) the lines that I get errors on. They're all the same error,</p>

<p>And here is the beginning of the policeOfficer class, in case I haven't appropriately declared friend status between the classes.</p>

<pre><code>class policeOfficer
{
private:
string name, badgeNumber;

friend class parkedCar;
friend class parkingMeter;

<p>There's a couple of errors. ""error C2027: use of undefined type""
""left of '.badgeNumber' must have class/struct/union""
""type name not allowed""
""identifier createTicket is undefined""</p>

<p>But they all center around that single line of code, plus a few others that I have written the same exact way.</p>

0,1,"<p>I came across a strange iPhone simulator issue. I have created an application which uses MKMapView to show a map. I want this map to be centered and therefor used the following code. </p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];

    CLLocationCoordinate2D location;

    location.latitude = 47.379022;
    location.longitude = 8.541001;

    MKCoordinateSpan span;

    span.latitudeDelta = 0.05;
    span.longitudeDelta = 0.05;

    MKCoordinateRegion region;

    region.center = location;
    region.span = span;

    [self.mapView setMapType:MKMapTypeStandard];
    [self.mapView setRegion:region animated:YES];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code works flawless in a fresh ""HelloMap"" Xcode project and does what it should - centering the map on Zurich. </p>

<p>But using the exact same code in another project puts the map to somewhere near the antarctica. I have already tried to clean the building environment by using ""Product"" -> ""Clean""... no changes. </p>

<p>Also deleting the app from the emulated iPhone doesn't make a change. I also used the Terminal to check and remove any remaining apps from the corresponding folder. </p>

<p>It even seems that changes made to the Xcode project are not (always) getting transferred to the iPhone simulator. E.g the MKMapView even loads when the source code above is commented out...</p>

<p>I am running out of ideas here... any input? </p>

<p>[EDIT]</p>

<p>Resetting the whole simulator by going to ""iOS-Simulator"" -> ""Inhalte und Einstellungen zurücksetzen"" made it work once only (!!) ... </p>

<p>[EDIT]</p>

<p>This seems to be a runtime issue. Putting the code from above into ""- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated"" makes it to behave correctly - at least almost. The user now sees an animated fly from the ""default location"" to my coordinates.</p>

<p>Where do I need to put the code so the map is at the right position when the view is loaded? </p>

Because of this error, I cannot test the code I've changed.</p>

<p>I believe I have the profiles and certificates set up correctly on xcode, when I look at my phone's provisioning profiles in the organizer I see ""Ad Hoc, Dist, Dev, and iOS Team Provisioning profile"" all with a ""Valid profile"" status..</p>

<p>But when I try to run the app on my phone I get the ""Code Sign error: Provisioning profile 'random letters and numbers"" cant be found..  I've searched this issue and came to the conclusion that I needed to modify my .xcodeproj project folder, specifically the project.pbxproj file.  I go to that file and delete the line ""provisioning_profile[sdk=iphoneos*]"" = ""random numbers and letters""..</p>

<p>Now when I run the app on my iphone after deleting that line it gives me the error ""libxml/tree.h"" file not found... I've found the fix to this problem, but once I fix it ill get the error ""openssl/ssl.h not found""..</p>

<p>What I would love to be able to do is send 'key presses', launch specific apps, and perhaps send gestures. On android there's monkeyrunner and other similar apps. However I haven't found much with respect to BB10, I know it's new but I can't be the only one with this request.</p>

<p>Also, how powerful is the telnet option? I can telnet into an emulator and change directory into the apps dir, but I can't list its contents, SUDO, or run anything.</p>

<p>*****UPDATE*******</p>

<p>I've made some progress WRT to this, but not much. It seems that you can use the Windows API to send mouse_evt messages to the VMWare emulator; it's not 100% reliable but works enough to open apps. The big hole I have right now is being able to detect state after the action/swipe/touch is executed, aka ""did the swipe I just execute work? Are we in the right app?"". It would be hugely beneficial to query the device's process list, but the 'devuser' account given in the telnet example can't really do anything. </p>

<p>This gist has the basics for how to touch and swipe the screen based on my experiences.

<p>From what I'm doing when start = 1 the matrix is read into inputblock. In this case the matrix is just filled with unique incremental values from 0 to 63. Then when done = 1 I output outblock which is the multiplied out matrix. The problem is that in my simulation I receive some values that are supposed to be in the final matrix but aren't in the correct order. For example the line below contains the first row in the multiplied matrix, tempblock:</p>

<pre><code> 14464.000  15157.000  15850.000  16543.000  17236.000  17929.000  18622.000  19315.000
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see in the picture of my simulation I get some of those values but then the signal becomes some weird large value.</p>

<p>I have some doubts that maybe din(0), din(1), din(2)...din(n) doesn't correspond to inputblock(0,0), inputblock(0,1), inputblock(0,2) etc. But I went over my behavioral file thoroughly and don't see any issues with it. Is there something wrong with how I've designed my testbench?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3xMfU.png"" alt=""Testbench: bottom signals are unsigned values""></p>

<p>EDIT: I need help in outputting for this        </p>

            end if;
            if (i &lt; 24) then
                din &lt;= 255;

<p>I thought it would be similar to the code in the answer but I ran into the same exact issue. How would this be fixed? Here is a picture of what is currently outputted. The correct values are there but just shifted by one clock period.

20087676,1,"<p>I'm hoping you guys can help me out. I have a small windows application written in C# that I'm making that is essentially a server listening for HTTP calls from an android device. The application basically acts as a remote - if it hears mute, it will mute the volume of the computer, and so on. My issue is I'm having some problems with pausing the foreground application. I'm specifically trying to imitate the play/pause button you see on so many keyboards these days. My method for doing so has been to use the Windows Input Simulator project (<a href=""http://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/</a>) to simulate that play/pause key. Unfortunately, I'm not getting any type of discernible response - nothing in particular is happening. Fearing my set up, I switched the VirtualKeyCode.MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE flag to the mute key flag and successfully muted my machine. Note that I am using Windows Media Player so I'm confident it's listening for the call.</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is, is there any extra setup I need to do before I can pause whatever media is currently playing? Are there any other ways to achieve what I'm after rather than simulating the key press? Any help would be much appreciated guys!</p>

<p>First screenshot from Simulator, second picture from Device:</p>

<p><strong>SOLVED:</strong> The app on the real iPhone has a base SDK 6.0 and the app that is on the Simulator has base SDK 7.0. So I guess the real device knew how to compensate for the low SDK base, unlike the simulator which behaved totally in a SDK 7.0 environment and thats why it was showing differently. thanks!</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8051141/how-do-i-enable-the-japanese-keyboard-on-the-iphone-simulator"">How do I enable the Japanese keyboard on the iPhone simulator?</a></p>

<p>I get it to worked in Xcode 4.6, iOS Simulator 6. Things go all well. But when I upgraded to Xcode 5, iOS Simulator 7, the dictionary is gone... I can't write kanji, or even kana... where has the dictionary gone? </p>

<p>How do I make it work in the iOS Simulator (because I don't have the real device) like back there? </p>

<p>Edit Note: Ok, don't get it wrong. I changed the keyboard to japanese. Since I tap on japanese characters, normally a suggestion kanji/kana will pop-up in the suggestion area. But with the dictionary gone, it doesn't have any words on the suggestion area. Therefore, I can't write kanji... </p>

<p>I tried delete Xcode 5, re-install Xcode 4, things goes well. Upgrade back to Xcode 5 (duplicated app with Xcode 4), iOS sim 6 still work fine with dict., but iOS 7 doesn't. What is with Xcode 5 and iOS 7?</p>

<p>Edit Note 2: I think it got something to do with </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>~/Library/Application Support/Iphone Simulator/7.0/</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I'm not sure what... I tried copy the keyboard bundle from 6.1 to 7.0, still not solve the problem... </p>

<p>Edit note 3: I asked google for a while, but can't find any English document about this problem. Maybe it's best to ask in Japanese, but I don't know much about Japanese :( This is requirement for my current project :(</p>

<p>Edit note 5: Chinese dictionary still works fine. Maybe I did something wrong...? How to fix this?</p>

<p>Edit note 6: It seems there's some problems with the built-in keyboard dictionary... Maybe it's me, maybe Xcode 5, delete the dictionary features... Somehow, I can't restore it even with re-install. It seems I need something like... reset keyboard dictionary function, as on the terminal. It doesn't available on the simulator, right? Any idea? </p>

<p>P/s: I'm also sorry if my English is bad. I tried to write as simple as possible, but not very proper... Since I'm bad at English's grammar.</p>

0,0,"<p>I am facing a situation, where I thought that Maven offers me the correct tools.
Either I am wrong or Maven ;o)</p>

<p>Seriously.</p>

<p>We are writing software to work with a 3rd party lib, let's call it prod.jar. This lib needs an environment that can connect to the prod.jar servers.
Obviously, our Jenkins is not and cannot be set up in this way. Thus, when running the tests with the prod.jar, everything will fail, as no connection can be set up.</p>

<p>My idea was to write a simulator that behaves like the real prod.jar and can be used for unit tests, called simulator.jar. Both, the prod.jar and the simulator.jar hold the same packages with the same class names. They only do differ in functionality. I have done this, to enable development and to cover as much on JUnit side on Jenkins. Of course, we also do test against the prod.jar, but not with Jenkins.</p>

<p>So what I did is to create two eclipse projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>prod-code: with a pom.xml that has prod.jar as a dependency</li>
<li>simulator-code: with a pom.xml that has the simulator.jar as a dependency</li>
</ul>

<p>So depending on which project you add as a dependency to the main project, either the simulator or the prod code are used. That works fine.</p>

<p>But then we get the error that the build contains the wrong jar.</p>

<p>How can I set up maven, if possible, so that I can use always the same pom, but maybe with different mvn parameters, to use the simulator during the test process and to use the prod code during the build process.</p>

<p>I tried with maven profiles, but when using the build jar, it will complain.</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;profiles&gt;
    &lt;profile&gt;

One is HypnosisViewController , the other is TimeViewController. 
What I wanted to check is how <strong>-(void)viewDidLoad</strong> works when IOS simulator gets memory warning. 
And I did</p>

<ol>
<li>Built and ran the app</li>
<li>The console said ""HypnosisViewcontroller loaded its view.""</li>
<li>Switched the other tab (TimeViewController)</li>
<li>Saw the message in the console. It says ""TabViewcontroller loaded its view""</li>
<li>Did the simulator memory warning command in IOS simulator</li>
<li>The console said ""HypnoTime Received memory warning.""</li>
<li>Switched back to the HypnosisViewcontroller to see whether the console says ""HypnosisViewcontroller loaded its view."" again.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>So the problem here is HypnosisViewcontroller is not destroyed and created again. (Because I can't see the log message when I switch back to HypnosisViewcontroller.)However I leaned the view not on the screen should be destroyed during the memory warning.</strong></p>

0,1,"<p>I have to program a cache simulator in C for my computer architecture class. I have no problems with what is required of me and my program is nearly finished, however I am having an issue with my CreateCache method. For some reason AFTER I create my cache, when I then go to insert a single address to the cache via index and tag, each set/block in the cache is identical. If I add one entry to a the 1st set in a 4 set cache, all 4 sets will then have that same tag. My cache needs to be able to support associative (n-ways) and direct, and also must include L1 L2 and L3 memory.</p>

<p>If anyone could please take a look at my method and struct and tell me if there are any apparent errors I would greatly appreciate it. I have been stuck on this for days and the assignment is due tomorrow. Thank you all in advance!!</p>

<p>Here is the structs I am using, as well as the createCache method.</p>

<pre><code>    typedef struct block {
    unsigned long tag;
    int valid; //0 for invalid, 1 valid
}block;

typedef struct set {
    int numBlocks;
    block *blks;
    int alg;
}set;


typedef struct Cache{
    int FIFO, LRU; //index for alg
    int hits, misses, reads, writes;
    unsigned long accesses;
    int cacheSize;
    int numSets;
    int numBlocks; //total blocks
    set *sets;
    int blockSize;
    int assoc;  //number of lines each in set
    int alg;
}Cache;
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the createCache method I am using. I think the error lies in how I used pointers and set up the arrays of sets and blocks.</p>

<pre><code>Cache createCache(int cacheSize, int blockSize, int alg, int assoc){
    if(cacheSize&lt;=0 || blockSize &lt;=0 || (alg!=0 &amp;&amp; alg!=1)){

0,0,"<p>So here is my code:</p>

<p>The purpose of it is to take in a single input tape, and the description of a turing machine and say whether or not the string was rejected.  I have had no issues with loading either the input tape or the description of the turing machine.<br>
My main issue comes when I am trying to get the machine to check more than just the first symbol in the input tape line. No matter how large I make the i in the for loop go to (i.e for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10000; i++)) it always flips out and says ""Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 1, Size: 1"".
 I tried recursion, while loops, and for loops. Perhaps I didn't have the right parameters. Tapem is an array list of all of the states in my turing machine.  Sample Tape is this (1 0 x 2 >) - Basically, if it is at the first state, and the current bit on the input string is a 0, we replace the 0 with an x and change the current stage to 2. The > means the next slot on the input tape we look at is a to the right of our current bit on the input string. Thanks in advance!</p>

Their site does say indicate it's record-and-replay but not sure if I

I have asked their forum as well. But, I am curios to know if anyone here
have tried it and have had some experiences to share.</p>

<ol>
<li>Are the real hardware sensor readings of a linked device available
on the Android emulator available in real-time? I saw it saying
""Sensor Relay"" which sounds like only record-and-replay of real
hardware sensor readings on the emulator linked to a real device.</li>
<li>If it's real-time, then how fast are the sensor readings reaching
from the linked device to the emulator?</li>
<li>Can any sensor-based application running on the emulator use these
sensor readings in real-time?</li>
<li>In order to use these sensor readings, do the sensor-based
applications need to be modified to include some extra specific code
to interact with some module of this simulator inside the emulator
from which the sensor readings are got and hence can be used within
that interacting sensor-based application in the emulator?</li>
<li>Why is Samsung Sensor Simulator not compatible with Linux variants
like Ubuntu?</li>
<li>Is it only compatible with Android 2.2 as it's mentioned in the
documentation and not higher?</li>
<li>Android SDK must be of API 9 - is this a must or will it also work
the latest API 19 but with some minor issues which can be ignored?</li>
<li>Can more than one sensor be active and be visualized in the eclipse
IDE plugin interface? If yes, assuming any sensor-based application
running on the emulator can use these sensor readings, can more than
one sensor-based application use the different sensors readings at
the same time in real-time?</li>

0,1,"<p>I am trying to simulate SMAC protocol using ns2.34. I have specified the routing protocol as AODV and smac syncflag is set to 1 with the initial energy of 50000 J. The JOURNAL_PAPER code has not been activated and no modifications have been done in the cpp modules of ns2. 
The network structure consists of 2 nodes only wherein node 0 is the udp agent node and node 1 is null agent node. CBR is attached to the udp agent. Both nodes are within the range of each other. All nam trace, agent trace, route trace and mac trace are ON.
No error is generated during execution of tcl file but the NAM output does not show any CBR transmission which has been attached to node 0. Kindly suggest changes required in ns2.34 for activating the NAM trace output in the animator.</p>

<p>I'm working on an app for athletes, doing sports like running or cycling. It should be based on Bluetooth LowEnergy. I have a real heartbeat sensor device to work with and there is the problem.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong> is that the sensor doesn't always work if I want to test the scan or something. My phone isn't able to find the sensor all the time, it works just one out of 30 attempts. So what I want to ask is, <strong>is there a way to simulate a BLE sensor device like a heartbeat-sensor (over the PC for example)?</strong></p>

<p>I have devices running 4.3 and higher (Samsung, LG and a Sony smartphone), so that shouldn't be the problem. Furthermore I already had a success in connecting to a BLE-Heartbeat sensor, but for testing it's really hard to work with a real sensor device (because of the problem that I can't find it all the time).</p>

<p>Hope my problem is understandable and somebody can help me!</p>

21069593,2,"<p>I'm designing a robot simulator for a university project and I've hit a big issue for some collision detection. Here is my robot.h header file:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef robot_h
#define robot_h

#include &lt;vector&gt;

enum direction
{
    UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT
};

enum motor
{
    STOP,SLOW,FAST
};

class robot
{
public:
    robot();

    char bot; // The bot onscreen
    int getX(); // The X position of robot
    int getY(); // The Y position of robot

    int dir; // The direction the robot is going

    bool touchSensor; // Boolean value if collision
    int lightSensor; // light sensor between 10-100
    int motorA; // Motor A between 0, 1 and 2
    int motorB; // Motor A between 0, 1 and 2
    void detection(int x, int y);

    void getReturnObject();
    bool returnObjectDash;
    bool returnObjectLine;

    void move(); // Moving the robot
    void draw(); // Drawing the robot on screen
    void update(); // Updating the robot position

private:
    int positionX; // Starting X value
    int positionY; // Starting Y value
};

#endif
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, I have two boolean values being used:
<code>returnObjectDash;</code>and <code>returnObjectLine</code>. I have this code in my matrix.cpp file:</p>

<pre><code>void matrix::detection(int x, int y)
{
    if(vector2D[x][y]=='-')
    {
        returnObjectDash=true;
        system(""pause"");
    }
    else
    {
        returnObjectDash=false;
    }
    if(vector2D[x][y]=='|')
    {
        returnObjectLine=true;
    }
    else
    {
        returnObjectLine=false;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Inside my robot.cpp I have this code which gets the two boolean values and then outputs to the console:</p>

<pre><code>void robot::getReturnObject()
{
    if(returnObjectDash==true)
    {
        std::cout&lt;&lt;""Dash\n"";
        //dir=DOWN;
    }
    if(returnObjectLine==true)
    {
        std::cout&lt;&lt;""Line\n"";
        //dir=DOWN;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is my main.cpp</p>

<pre><code>int main()
{
    robot r;

    while(true)
    {
        matrix m;
        m.robotPosition(r.getX(), r.getY());
        m.update(); // vector2D init and draw
        m.detection(m.getX(), m.getY());  
        r.update();
        Sleep(250);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm setting the default value of my two boolean variables in my matrix.cpp default constructor to false. When I hit the pause button and debug I seem to be getting two different returns. For my matrix it is returning false, though for my robot it is returning true, it is like my program is making two different variables. If someone could shed some light on this weird behaviour, then please do tell! Thank you</p>

0,1,"<p>When my simulation, using Omnet++, starts, there is a .ned file describing the initial scenario (in my case it shows a certain type of a network configuration). During the simulation this scenario changes, come times it changes very much. Is there a way to get a .ned file describing the final scenario after the simulation has ended? So that I can analyze it with a script...

0,1,"<p>i would like to ask, if someone had encountered problem with Microsoft Mediaroom ADK version 3.0.3.3. I am trying to create application using Boundlist as vertical list, which gets data from xml file.</p>

<p>But when I set attribute ""VisibleItemCount"" to value 1 or 2 and my xml file contains more than 5 entries, which I need to display, I encounter a problem that I am not able to fix.
When I reach the last entry, I am still able to push ""down"" button on remote, which will get me to the first entry again, when I push it again, its still stuck at the first entry. </p>

<p>I was trying to debug my application with Simulator Console, but what I got suprised me: the client asks for more entries, than XML contains, e.g. last entry is at index 5, but client asks for more : ""XMLFile.xml?startIndex=12&amp;itemCount=1&amp;direction=Down""</p>

22108816,2,"<p>I am writing a simulator program for a custom microcontroler in C++. I would like a user to be able to use GDB to debug their program as if it was running on the real target.</p>

<p>The best solution I've found seems to involve writing a GDB stub for my simulator that would communicate with GDB using a network protocol. However, this involves writing a complete program that would take care of network communication and communication with GDB itself.</p>

<p>This seems a bit overkill since the client and the target will be running on the same machine. Is there not a simpler way? If there is not, with the popularity of GDB, I would have thought that a library, or at least examples, would exist to help embedding a stub in a normal desktop PC program?</p>

0,1,"<p>I've written a hello-world program for an 8-bit PIC microcontroller and want to run it on the MPLAB X IDE simulator. </p>

<p>I want to create a stimulus on its pins, and have the result appear in the microcontroller's register which corresponds to the input pins, (having set a watch on the register).</p>

<p>What I have achieved so far: The program seems to run fine on the simulator, and I can create an ""asynchronous"" stimulus, i.e. fire a change of the stimulus (such as applying a logic 0 on an input pin) when I click the ""fire"" button. This changes the contents of the <code>PORTC</code> register. However I cannot get ""synchronous"" stimulus to work (e.g. automatically toggling the stimulus logic value applied to an input pin). <code>PORTC</code> does not change. (However the simulator output suggests the stimulus is being applied).</p>

<p>There are examples written by Microchip for the MPLAB 8.x IDE simulator which I have tried to apply to MPLAB X (v2.0) but I cannot get working. To establish what I'm doing wrong, (or if I'm encountering a bug), <strong>perhaps someone could help in one of the following ways:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Give an example of a working hello-world</li>
<li>Spot any errors in the process I've followed (see below for my steps)</li>
<li>Follow my steps to see if the problem can be replicated</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This is what I have tried:</strong></p>

<p>Summary of steps followed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create project and set target device to be ""PIC16F77""</li>
<li>Add source file <code>main.c</code></li>
<li>Set the simulator as the hardware tool, and XC8 as the C compiler</li>
<li>Add a variable watch on the <code>PORTC</code> special function register</li>
<li>Configure an asynchronous stimulus</li>
<li>Configure a synchronous stimulus</li>
<li>Build project</li>
<li>Run in debug mode </li>
<li>Single-step the program and look for changes of the <code>PORTC</code> register.</li>
</ol>

<p>Create a new project in the MPLAB X IDE with a source file <code>main.c</code>, and selecting ""PIC16F77"" as the target device:</p>

<pre><code> #include &lt;htc.h&gt;  
 __CONFIG(  
      FOSC_HS  
     &amp; WDTE_OFF  
     &amp; PWRTE_OFF  
     &amp; BOREN_OFF  
 );  
 void main(void) {  
     // set tristate port directions: 1=input, 0=output  
     TRISC = 0b11111111;  
     while (1);  
 } 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>I add a variable watch on the <code>PORTC</code> SFR register:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dzVGz.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Configure an asynchronous stimulus in the window/tab <code>Stimulus &gt; Asynchronous</code> :</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQJ6p.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Configure a synchronous stimulus in the window/tab <code>Stimulus &gt; Pin/Register Actions</code></strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yfIpZ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Then finally:</p>

<p>I build the project, run in debug mode, pause, and single-step through the program.</p>

<p>When I click on the ""fire"" button of the asynchronous stimulus and then click the Step-Over button, the value in PORTC register changes as expected.</p>

<p>But when running through the program, the synchronous stimulus never seems to have any effect. It appears that the stimuli are repeatedly being applied, but there is no effect on the value in the <code>PORTC</code> register. It can be seen in the window/tab: <code>Output &gt; Stimulus</code> that the stimulus is being applied:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lFGqu.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I don't understand why the asynchronous stimulus works fine, but the synchronous stimulus appears to be applied but is not producing the desired effect. </p>

0,1,"<p>This is gonna be a bit of a large question (at least for me it seems) so bear with me. We're making a y86 simulator in C and this part of the assignment is supposed to open a file, load it into memory, perform a dump, and exit. The main method is provided to do these things, we're just supposed to create the loader.c and loader.h files to actually do the loading. The load function returns true(1) if the load was successful (input file was free of errors) and false(0) otherwise. Right now, I'm stuck on the load function, and I think the issue is on around line 58-67 of loader.c. I'm not calling the method properly, but I cannot figure out how to format the numbers properly. This is the first time I'm working in C, so it's still a rather confusing for me. If needed I can provide more code. So far I've included loader.c, loader.h, memory.c, and memory.h. Bool.h is included, but it's just a typedef for true-false so I figured I could leave it out. I apologize if this is a bit much, but I'm completely stumped and I don't know where else to go. Thank you so much in advance for any help given, it will be greatly appreciated!</p>

0,0,"<p>I am currently working, with Matlab, on a 3D simulator whose aim is to move an object (currently it's just a  simple circle) in space (using plot3). </p>

<p>Although it's easy to compute a trajectory without any rotation of my object, I do not manage to rotate my object around its own axis. Indeed, I have computed the 3 well-known rotation matrix but it (of course) rotate  my object (represented by a set of points) around the axis of my figure (in the ""world"" system).</p>

<p>For example, the center of inertia of my object (currently the center of my circle) is I whose coordinates are (Xi,Yi,Zi). Thus, I suppose that I need to define an additional system for my object to be able to rotate my object about these 3 new axis composing such a system...</p>

<p>I would like something like:</p>

<p><code>[X2,Y2,Z2]=Mat*[X1,Y1,Z1]</code> where <code>[X1,Y1,Z1]</code> is the coordinates of a point of my object before the rotation, <code>[X2,Y2,Z2]</code> the coordinates after the rotation and Mat the matrix I am looking for. Of course, the center of inertia must be unchanged whichever the rotation (yaw and/or pitch or/and roll)</p>

<p>I'm attempting to build a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_event_simulation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Discrete Event Simulation</a> library by following <a href=""http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~agupta/_projects/networking/QueueSimulation/mm1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this tutorial</a> and fleshing it out.  I am limited to using VBA, so ""just switch to [insert language here] and it's easy!"" is unfortunately not possible. I have specifically chosen to implement this in Access VBA to have a convenient location to store configuration information and metrics. </p>

<p><strong><em>How should I handle logging metrics in my Discrete Event Simulation engine?</em></strong></p>

<p>If you don't want/need background, skip to <em>The Design</em> or <em>The Question</em> section below...</p>

<p><strong>Simulation</strong></p>

<p>The goal of a simulation of the type in question is to model a process to perform analysis of it that wouldn't be feasible or cost-effective in reality.</p>

<p>The canonical example of a simulation of this kind is a Bank:</p>

<ul>
<li>Customers enter the bank and get in line with a statistically distributed frequency</li>
<li>Tellers are available to handle customers from the front of the line one by one taking an amount of time with a modelable distribution</li>
<li>As the line grows longer, the number of tellers available may have to be increased or decreased based on business rules</li>
</ul>

<p>You can break this down into generic objects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Entity: These would be the customers</li>
<li>Generator: This object generates Entities according to a distribution</li>
<li>Queue: This object represents the line at the bank.  They find much real world use in acting as a buffer between a source of customers and a limited service.</li>
<li>Activity: This is a representation of the work done by a teller.  It generally processes Entities from a Queue</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Discrete Event Simulation</strong></p>

<p>Instead of a continuous tick by tick simulation such as one might do with physical systems, a ""Discrete Event"" Simulation is a recognition that in many systems only critical events require process and the rest of the time nothing important to the state of the system is happening.</p>

<p>In the case of the Bank, critical events might be a customer entering the line, a teller becoming available, the manager deciding whether or not to open a new teller window, etc.</p>

<p>In a Discrete Event Simulation, the flow of time is kept by maintaining a Priority Queue of Events instead of an explicit clock.  Time is incremented by popping the next event in chronological order (the minimum event time) off the queue and processing as necessary.</p>

<p><strong>The Design</strong></p>

<p>I've got a Priority Queue implemented as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue#Usual_implementation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Min Heap</a> for now.</p>

<p>In order for the objects of the simulation to be processed as events, they implement an ISimulationEvent interface that provides an EventTime property and an Execute method. Those together mean the Priority Queue can schedule the events, then Execute them one at a time in the correct order and increment the simulation clock appropriately.</p>

<p>The simulation engine is a basic event loop that pops the next event and Executes it until there are none left.  An event can reschedule itself to occur again or allow itself to go idle.  For example, when a Generator is Executed it creates an Entity and then reschedules itself for the generation of the next Entity at some point in the future.</p>

<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>

<p><em>How should I handle logging metrics in my Discrete Event Simulation engine?</em></p>

<p>In the midst of this simulation, it is necessary to take metrics.  How long are Entities waiting in the Queue? How many Acitivity resources are being utilized at any one point? How many Entities were generated since the last metrics were logged?</p>

<p>It follows logically that the metric logging should be scheduled as an event to take place every few units of time in the simulation.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that this ends up being a cross-cutting concern: metrics may need to be taken of Generators or Queues or Activities or even Entities. Consider also that it might be necessary to take derivative calculated metrics: e.g. measure a, b, c, and ((a-c)/100) + Log(b).</p>

<p>I'm thinking there are a few main ways to go:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have a single, global Stats object that is aware of all of the simulation objects.  Have the Generator/Queue/Activity/Entity objects store their properties in an associative array so that they can be referred to at runtime (VBA doesn't support much in the way of reflection). This way the statistics can be attached as needed <code>Stats.AddStats(Object, Properties)</code>. This wouldn't support calculated metrics easily unless they are built into each object class as properties somehow.</p></li>
<li><p>Have a single, global Stats object that is aware of all of the simulation objects. Create some sort of ISimStats interface for the Generator/Queue/Activity/Entity classes to implement that returns an associative array of the important stats for that particular object. This would also allow runtime attachment, <code>Stats.AddStats(ISimStats)</code>. The calculated metrics would have to be hardcoded in the straightforward implementation of this option.</p></li>
<li><p>Have multiple Stats objects, one per Generator/Queue/Activity/Entity as a child object. This might make it easier to implement simulation object-specific calculated metrics, but clogs up the Priority Queue a little bit with extra things to schedule. It might also cause tighter coupling, which is bad :(.</p></li>
<li><p>Some combination of the above or completely different solution I haven't thought of?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Let me know if I can provide more (or less) detail to clarify my question!</p>

0,1,"<p>I'm creating a MIPS simulator, and have come across a point that I think has multiple solutions. SPIM simulates reads from the console with syscall operations. I have used SPIM before but currently do not have access to it. How does it deal with incorrect types when reading from the console? For instance, if you do a syscall for read_int, and enter ""asdf"" and then press enter, what happens? What should happen? SPIM references suggest that it reads an integer from the line, and ignores anything after the integer, which is simply just a regex match for the first sequence of digits. What happens when there are non-digits first, then digits, then more non digits? What about no digits at all?</p>

<p>I don't wish to recreate SPIM, and figured I would get recommendations from the community on how they would like a MIPS simulator to perform when given the wrong type of input.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>libgmalloc's behavior can be changed with several additional
  environment variables:</p>
  
  <p>MALLOC_PROTECT_BEFORE</p>
  
  <p>If this flag is set, then libgmalloc tries harder to detect buffer
  underruns.  Specifically, libgmalloc places the start of the allocated
  buffer at the beginning of a virtual memory page, then protects the page
  before.  Buffer underruns then cause an error.  The behavior without
  this variable set is to place the end of the buffer at the end of the
  last page of the allocation, and protect the page after.</p>

In my project I use a JPanel to draw my content. I can move it and zoom it using AffineTransformations. Each time paint() is called I draw the area of the drawing the user is supposed to see. The drawing can be very big (i have no restrictions on how big it can be). I use a Rectangle that tracks the visible area of my drawing and the draws it in the JPanel graphics2d.</p>

<p>Now I want to add scrollbars to move my viewport I think that JScrollPane can be useful. I have seen a lot of threads talking about using a JPanel with JScrollPane to scroll simple content. The first when you look is <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/scrollpane.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>, but I do not like this solutions because the scrollpane really scrolls the JPanel. And in all the examples I am supposed to draw ALL THE PANEL AREA!. I only draw the visible area of the panel because it is very time consuming. </p>

<p>So, my question is: How can I use the scrollpane to move my custom viewport and reflect the changes (i do not want to scroll the jpanel I use for drawing)? Or should I use a JPanel and two simple JScrollbars?</p>

24325700,3,"<p>I'm in a situation where I think that two implementations are correct, and I don't know which one to choose.</p>

<p>I've an application simulating card readers. It has a GUI where you choose which serial port, and speed to use, and a play and stop button.</p>

<p>I'm looking for the best implementation for reader construction.</p>

<p>I have a <code>SimulatorCore</code> class who's living as long as my application
SimulatorCore instantiate the <code>Reader</code> class. And it will be possible to simulate multiple readers on multiple serial port.</p>

<p>Two possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My <code>Reader</code> is a pointer (dynamic instantiation), I instantiate it when play button is hit, delete it when stop button is hit.</p></li>
<li><p>My <code>Reader</code> is an object (static instantiation), I instantiate it in <code>SimulatorCore</code> constructor then create and call <code>Reader.init()</code> and <code>Reader.cleanup()</code> into my Reader class and call these when play and stop are being hit</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I personally see the functional side, and I clearly want to use pointer, and do not have any reader instantiate if no reader are simulated.</p>

<p>Someone say me that I should use static instantiation (Reason : for safety, and because ""it's bad to use pointer when you have choice to not use them"")</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with them, but I think I can also use smart pointer.</p>

<p><strong>Code samples: 1st solution:</strong></p>

<pre><code>class SimulatorCore
{  
    play(){reader = new Reader();};
    stop(){delete reader; reader = nullptr;};

private:
    Reader *reader;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Code samples: 2nd solution:</strong></p>

<pre><code>class SimulatorCore
{  
    play(){reader.init();};
    stop(){reader.cleanup();};

private:
    Reader reader;
}

For example, to browse [x] links deep, or randomly jump from page to page, or to randomly fill and submit forms, maybe even generate some erroneous requests. It's important to support all HTTP verbs (PUT, HEAD, DELETE, ...etc.), and hopefully, but not necessarily, command line. It'd be a very big plus to have randomizable fields (IP address, User-Agent, ...etc.)</p>

<p>I'm freaking out because I have a deadline to publish this for a business, and this is a major set back. Also, my storyboard is 'red' in the build phases too! I'm worried I've lost my whole application which could not be recovered. Right now, my app is saved on my phone when it did successfully connect to my device.</p>

<p>I've tried literally everything from cleaning to changing the armv7, arm64, etc.</p>

The model boots at level EL3 / 64 bits, and I managed to go down to level EL1 / 32 bits, but I encounter some issues (in a few words, the timer doesn't tick and some kprintf are missing, but that's not the issue here).</p>

<p>To debug my UART issue, I wanted to use the led / switches provides by the model. I can read their value from software quite easily, but I can't write a new value to either of them. The kernel seems to hang. Here is a minimal asm code that writes to the switches register:</p>

<pre><code>.global Start
Start: 
    # we are in EL3 / 64 bits mode
    # create the 0x1C010000 + 0x4 address of switches
    mov  x0, #4
    movk x0, #0x1c01, lsl #16
    # value to write
    mov  w1, #0xaa
    # actual writing
    strb w1, [x0]
</code></pre>

<p>It seems I am stuck at the <code>strb</code> instruction. For the record, if I replace <code>strb</code> with <code>ldrb</code>, I can correctly read and display the value of this register (I played with the <code>--switches</code> flag to be sure it worked).</p>

<p>Any one knows what I am doing wrong here ?</p>

0,1,"<p>in my iOS7 app I use:</p>

<pre><code>screenRect = [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds];
screenWidth = screenRect.size.width;
screenHeight = screenRect.size.height;
</code></pre>

<p>I then use screenHeight for loading different view regarding if device is iPhone 4 or iPhone 5.</p>

<p>The main problem is, when I was checking the app for iOS 8 the simulator return exchanged values in landscape orientation so screenHeight vas actually screenWidth and it loads the wrong view. Ok I solved that, but we did not put any updates yet on App Store, because application is working just fine on actual device with iOS 8. It loads a proper view.</p>

<p>The actual device with iOS8 on landscape return values as before on iOS7, but on simulator iOS 8 the values are exchanged as they should be. Now it is very hard for me to decide if I put an update or not. </p>

<p>Does anybody know what is happening?</p>

<p>Thank you, Matej</p>

<p>Here's the latest configuration I'm using:
Tool Set:
    XCODE V 5 .1

For the OpenSSL build I'm using a script based on <a href=""https://github.com/x2on/OpenSSL-for-iPhone"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/x2on/OpenSSL-for-iPhone</a></p>

I have xCode installed and can launch the iOS simulator, but there seems to be no way to install an .app file. The ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator folder is a complete mystery and there is no clear location to drop the app files. </p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Alternatively, is there an easier way to record a video of your iOS app? People must do it all the time for tutorials... </p>

What could cause that to happen?</p>

27786506,2,"<h2><strong>Context</strong></h2>

<p>I am working on a brushless DC motor controller project.
I need a technique that would allow me to simulate the code controlling a virtual model of a brushless motor (written in C).</p>

<h2><strong>Challenge</strong></h2>

<p>The difficulty is to to check that my interrupts are correctly set to avoid burning my development board or damaging my motor.This is why I would like the AVR studio simulator and a model of my motor.
For that, I have already some C code simulating a brushless DC motor and I would like to run that motor simulation code in parallel with my microcontroller code.</p>

<p>I wish not to run the motor code in the simulator as well because it makes uses of floating point arithmetic: I want this motor code to run on my PC.</p>

<h2><strong>First step towards a result</strong></h2>

<p>I found a way to <a href=""http://www.atmel.com/webdoc/simulator/simulator.wb_Simulator2_Stimuli.Stimuli_file_format.html"" rel=""nofollow"">stimulate the editor</a>. Unfortunately, I must create the input sequence before hand in a file and this is not convenient because my motor simulator must react depending on the microcontroller code.
It seems that a good approach could leverage <a href=""http://www.atmel.com/webdoc/atmelstudio/ch09s07s01.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Python debug scripting interface</a>. </p>

<h2><strong>Question</strong></h2>

<p>However, the documentation seems to be lacking information: how do I input values to the AVR Studio 6 simulator to the Python scripting interface? </p>

<p>In Xcode 6, the iOS simulator's <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/26004815/700471"">keyboard behavior changed</a> to be similar to a real device, and now there is a menu item to connect/disconnect your Mac's keyboard to the simulator: <strong>Hardware > Keyboard > Connect Hardware Keyboard</strong>.</p>

<p>I don't mind this, but what happens when your Mac's keyboard is connected is that the simulator will no longer show the software keyboard.  When you run a test script with UIAutomation, calls like <code>UIATarget.localTarget().frontMostApp().keyboard().typeString(""myString"");</code> will fail because the keyboard doesn't appear, even when you've made a text field the first responder.</p>

<p>This is annoying, because if I do any manual testing in the simulator, I will need to remember to disable the hardware keyboard before I run any of my UIAutomation tests, or they will all fail.</p>

<p>Is there any way, from within a UIAutomation JS script, to check hardware keyboard settings and disable them?  Or, any way to do this from the command line, prior to executing the UIAutomation script?</p>

When one level is complete a button becomes visible and when clicked it changes the table to make the next level unlocked.

<p>The <code>gameOver</code> function is called from a different function and if winner or not bad then the button becomes visible, then when clicked the button goes to my play file which holds my table with levels. It uses the <code>levelMod</code> function to unlock the levels.</p>

levels = {

  2,2,2,2,2,
  2,2,2,2,2,

  { getFile=""lock .png"", types=""locked"" },
  { getFile=""greenchecked.png"", types=""done"" }
}

<p>That's in the main chunk of my play file which sets the table to locked or unlocked. Then:</p>

<pre><code>saveInfo()
</code></pre>

<p>is put in my show event scene.</p>

<p>In my program I tried only to create a wave height field at time <code>t = 0</code> without any further changes in time. After execution of my program I got not what I was expecting:<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSW7r.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here's my source code:</p>

<pre><code>clear all; close all; clc;
rng(11); % setting seed for random numbers

meshSize = 64; % field size
windDir = [1, 0]; % ||windDir|| = 1
patchSize = 64;
A = 1e+4;
g = 9.81; % gravitational constant
windSpeed = 1e+2;

x1 = linspace(-10, 10, meshSize+1); x = x1(1:meshSize);
y1 = linspace(-10, 10, meshSize+1); y = y1(1:meshSize);
[X,Y] = meshgrid(x, y);

H0 = zeros(size(X)); % height field at time t = 0

for i = 1:meshSize
    for j = 1:meshSize
        kx = 2.0 * pi / patchSize * (-meshSize / 2.0 + x(i)); % = 2*pi*n / Lx
        ky = 2.0 * pi / patchSize * (-meshSize / 2.0 + y(j)); % = 2*pi*m / Ly
        P = phillips(kx, ky, windDir, windSpeed, A, g); % phillips spectrum
        H0(i,j) = 1/sqrt(2) * (randn(1) + 1i * randn(1)) * sqrt(P);

end

H0 = H0 + conj(H0);

surf(X,Y,abs(ifft(H0)));

<p>And the <code>phillips</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>function P = phillips(kx, ky, windDir, windSpeed, A, g)
    k_sq = kx^2 + ky^2;
    L = windSpeed^2 / g;
    k = [kx, ky] / sqrt(k_sq);
    wk = k(1) * windDir(1) + k(2) * windDir(2);
    P = A / k_sq^2 * exp(-1.0 / (k_sq * L^2)) * wk^2;
end

<p>Is there any matlab ocean simulation source code which could help me to understand my mistakes? Fast google search didn't get any results.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's a ""correct"" result I got from ""CUDA FFT Ocean Simulation"". I didn't achieve this behavior in Matlab yet but I've ploted ""surf"" in matlab using data from  ""CUDA FFT Ocean Simulation"". Here's what it looks like:

<hr>

<p>I've made an experiment and got an interesting result:</p>

<p>I've taken generated <code>h0</code> from ""CUDA FFT Ocean Simulation"". So I have to do ifft to transform from frequency domain to spatial domain to plot the graph. I've done it for the same <code>h0</code> using matlab <code>ifft</code> and using <code>cufftExecC2C</code> from CUDA library. Here's the result:</p>

<p>CUDA ifft:

<p>Matlab ifft:

<p>Either I don't understand some aspects of realization of <code>cufftExecC2C</code> or <code>cufftExecC2C</code> and matlab ifft are different algorithms with different results.</p>

<p>According to the documentation, the two hidden fields I have simply get passed to PayPal and then back to my PHP script. To get these values, would it be correct to use the following:</p>

<p>Before you ask, I can't seem to send these custom fields using the simulator, unless the fields are encapsulated within the custom field? The documentation and help seems to be lacking here. Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>I found that I cannot install old simulator into Xcode 6.2 by coping now. I tried to download the 7.1 simulator in Xcode, but always get a no response message. Is there another way to install iOS 7.1 simulator for Xcode 6.2?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

29058447,1,"<p>I am about to write a Simulator of sorts in C++. It is a console application which...simulates stuff and has a REST-ful socket API to stuff which impacts/contributes to the simulation. In order to see what is going on in the simulation, I had the maybe brilliant idea to generate series of images (bitmaps) which reflect the simulator state. And then to simply stream this as a movie so I can watch my simulator simulating from a media player, such as VLC or Windows media player. Or to save the video to a file (second option). Or both.</p>

<p>Being on Windows 7 (x64), Windows Media Foundation looks like the technology to use for that. Only I do not feel about becoming a Media foundation expert and would rather focus on my simulator.</p>

<p>Here is how it is supposed to work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simulator code has state, which can be rendered to a bitmap (width, height, ...). The simulator is not running in real-time (is not clocked). It does its calculations and depending on what happens to the simulators input, the the state changes in non-periodic ways.</li>
<li>Whenever the state changes, render a bitmap and queue it up for video output. Since the video is (depending on video stream encoding) expecting some kind of constant frame rate, the last image shall be simply re-transmitted until there is a new frame, thus creating the video. But they seem to treat the frame-duration rather like a constant.</li>
<li>Media foundation does not seem to contain ready-made code to realize a (UDP or TCP based RTP/RSTP) interface to my application. So I hope it can do the conversion from a bitmap to a jpeg frame for me and provide me with some form of media clock.
<ul>
<li>I think I figured out how those RTP etc. headers work and can easily program the network side myself. If that approach is the fastest one.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>What I find difficult right now is to figure out how to best orchestrate and select the parts of Media foundation which would do the encoding.</p>

<p>I think I have to implement a custom <code>IMFMediaSource</code> COM object and use that as the start of the pipeline. But I did not find out how to get the encoded jpeg images or some <code>IMFMediaSink</code> video stream data back from the pipeline so I can feed my network layer with it.</p>

<p>So here my set of questions I need help with from you Media foundation experts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a shortcut for me to do what I have in mind? I am not fixated on RTP/RTSP - any form of video format will do. As long as the amount of work I have to invest is minimal and I can use a standard player.</li>
<li>Can someone create a short list for me what I would have to do? It can be pretty bird-view. Like ""Create COM object which implements interfaces [list] - Use Mediafoundation codecs and whatnot [names] to build the pipeline - Implement IMFMediaSink in your sink object and get the data like...this ... The media clock is provided by (do I have to clock the pipeline from the back as it is a pull model or is the IMFMediaSink driven by some clock from within the session?) etc.""?</li>
<li>If I were to use a h.264 encoder - can I get the data back or is it only rendering to file? Would I need extra protocol headers to stream that via a network socket?</li>
</ul>

<p>As I have experience in COM programming and other basics, all I really need is a shortcut so I do not have to study and trial-and-error with Media Foundation to find out how to realize this use case or at least have information helping me to find a good starting point for my efforts.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Here a draft of how the application could access this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;cstdint&gt;

struct SourceFormatDescriptor
{
    uint32_t width;
    uint32_t height;
    uint32_t colorDepth; // Bytes per pixel -&gt; RGB (3 bytes per pixel) | RGBA (4 bytes per pixel)
};

struct IVideoStreamReceiver
{
    virtual void Starting() = 0;
    virtual void Ending() = 0;
    virtual uint32_t MaxChunkSize() = 0; // Somehow network protocol MTU related
    // Can/should be directly forwarded to network layer and/or saved to file.
    virtual void VideoChunk(size_t chunkSize, const uint8_t* chunk) = 0;
};

// Application object behind which all video rendering voodoo will be implemented.
class VideoRenderer
{
    // Is initialized once and fixed while the streaming is done.
    SourceFormatDescriptor m_sourceDescriptor;

public:
    VideoRenderer(const SourceFormatDescriptor&amp; sourceDescriptor);

    void Start();
    void Stop();

    // Not sure who drives the renderer (Media foundation or external clock?)
    void MediaClockTick(); // dummy reminder function

    void AddReceiver(IVideoStreamReceiver* receiver);

    // Whenever a new frame is rendered it is passed to the video renderer.
    void NewFrame(const uint8_t * frameData, size_t frameSize);
};

On simulator 7.1 tap-through works, but on 8.1 don't work.Also I asked earlier similar question, but not the same as this and I solved it using nodesAtPoint method and then looping trough all nodes and checking node name / class... But this differs because now I use custom Button class which implements touchesBegan and I want it to detect and if possible ""swallow"" touches.</p>

<p>So I have a simple Button class which is subclass of SKSpriteNode and it has it's own touchesBegan and <code>userInteractionEnabled = YES</code>. In my view controller property <code>ignoreSiblingsOrder</code> is set to <code>YES</code>.</p>

<p>I just don't understand why this doesn't work on 8.1...I know that hit-testing goes in opposite order then rendering nodes, but then what would be the right way to achieve tap-through behaviour? So currently what's happening is when I test on 7.1 I got message ""yellow button"", but on 8.1 I got message ""touch detected"" (and when I print node name it says root). Also I have been <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26900885/ios-8-0-simulator-not-detecting-touched-node"">pointed to file a radar</a> because of this, but as I said I solved everything with nodesAtPoint instead of nodeAtPoint so I didn't. And because I thought that that's not a bug, but rather my mistake, because on 7.1 everything was fine. So is this a bug, or something else ?</p>

29712214,1,"<p>I am writing an assembly program on the LC3 machine.</p>

<p>My assembly program is an  LC3 program that multiplies R2 and R3 and stores the result in R1.  </p>

<p>Here is my source code(with comments)</p>

<pre><code>;Sets pc to this address at start of program 
.ORIG x3000
;R1 will store the result lets clear it(ANd with 0)
AND R1,R1,x0
;R2 will be multiplied by R3, let's clear both of them 
AND R2,R2,x0
AND R3,R3,x0
;Test case 4 * 3 = 12;
ADD R2,R2,4
ADD R3,R3,3
;Add to increment zone 
LOOP Add R1,R1,R2;
;Decrement the counter, in this case the 3 or R3
ADD R3,R3,x-1
BrP LOOP
HALT

</code></pre>

<p>My test case is multiplying 4 * 3. The result should be 12 and that should be stored in R1. However when I run this program in my LC3 simulator, this is what i get for the output<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tg7fE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>R3 holds the correct value at the end but R1 holds -1.... Does anyone see an issue with my code? I made sure to clear R1 at the beginning and to keep adding R3 to R1 and storing the result to R1 while the counter, R3, or 3 in this case is greater than zero.</p>

<p>I have an app that has a sqlite database (called ""myDatabase.sqlite""). In order to get this to work in the simulator build, I found the path for it by using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>        let fileManager = NSFileManager.defaultManager()
    let dirPaths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(.DocumentDirectory, .UserDomainMask, true)

    let docsDir = dirPaths[0] as! String

    databasePath = docsDir.stringByAppendingPathComponent(""myDatabase.sqlite"")

    let database = FMDatabase(path: databasePath as String)
</code></pre>

<p>This works in the simulator, but I had to physically put the file in that path.</p>

<p>For on-device testing, I'd like this to transfer with the bundle. I have that same database copied into the app bundle (oops, I don't have enough reputation to post images, but it's underneath one of my view controllers in the list of files in the app bundle).</p>

<p>When I run the build on the device, though, I get the following readout from the console:</p>

<blockquote>

29870540,1,"<p>I have trying to build a simulator of Ingenico POS terminal (iWL220).
The main screen I have a combo-box. Once user enter id and password the combo-box load 6 menus. If User click btn1 then combo-box clear the menu and add another set of menu. If user click <code>btn1</code> for new loaded menu then again combo-box cleared and load another set of menu so on.</p>

<p>My problem is for each button click (btn1, btn2, btn3, btn4, btn5) I have to code lot of if else statement. Example;</p>

<p>First menu (on combo-box) has 6 sector. </p>

<ul>
<li>1.SectorA</li>
<li>2.SectorB</li>
<li>3.SectorC</li>
<li>4.SectorD</li>
<li>5.SectorE</li>
<li>6.SectorF</li>
</ul>

<p>If user choose 1.SectorA then user click btn1. Then btn1 clear the combo-box and loads another set of menu. This time menu (on combo-box) has 3 companies.</p>

<ul>
<li>1.CompanyA</li>
<li>2.CompanyB</li>
<li>3.CompanyC</li>
</ul>

<p>This time user choose 1.CompanyA then user click again btn1. Then btn1 clear the combo-box and loads another set of menu. This time menu (on combo-box) has 2 payment option.</p>

<ul>
<li>1.FullPayment</li>
<li>2.ParitalPayment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now this time if user click btn1 or btn2 the combo-box visible become false and in main screen there is a label and text box. The text box allows user to enter the subscriber number and press enter (green button).</p>

<p>I already load Ingenico terminal picture as jpeg and top of it I set my buttons. 
I gave only small version of my simulation. In my app there are 114 probability that user can choose.  </p>

<p>In my app btn1 has 92 probability to be clicked, btn2 has 53 probability to be clicked and so on. After user enters the subscriber number and click green button the my app use wfc services to format the data and send to sql server. 
But before user click each combination of button some where in my app I store the btn number as 422. This 422 means, user chose SectorD + CompanyB + ParitalPayment option. So my wfc will know what it is mean 422.</p>

<p>My question is what is the shortest way to construct my button events for this 114 probability case? </p>

<hr>

<p>I have 4 buttons. Btn1, Btn2, Btn3 and Btn4. Also I have some arrays as it shown below and 1 combo-box.</p>

<pre><code>1.ArrayMain() = {“1.Water”,”2.Air”,”3.Soil”,”4.Fire”}
   1.1. ArrayWater() = {“1.Salty”,”2.Fresh”, “3.Contaminated”}
      1.1.1.ArraySalty() = {1.”AA”, 2.”BB”, 3.”CC”}
      1.1.2.ArrayFresh() = {1.”DD”, 2.”EE”, 3.”FF”}
      1.1.3.ArrayContaminated() = {1.”XX”, 2.”YY”, 3.”ZZ”}                              

1.2   ArrayAir() = {“1.Fresh”, “2.Contaminated”}
1.3   ArraySoil() = {“1.Normal”, “2.Contaminated”}
1.4   ArrayFire() = {“1.Low”,”2.Mid”,”3.High”}
</code></pre>

<p>When my app starts, first array values <code>1.(ArrayMain)</code> fills the comboBox. This comboBox will have 4 values as,  “1.Water”, ”2.Air”, ”3.Soil”, ”4.Fire” in it. If user choose “1.Water” than user clicks Btn1. Than btn1 events clears the comboBox and loads <code>1.1ArrayWater()</code> values into comboBox.</p>

<p>Second time if user chooses “1.Salty” than user clicks again btn1 and this time btn1 events clears the comboBox and loads <code>1.1.1ArraySalty()</code> values into comboBox. </p>

<p>Third time if user chooses “2.BB” than user clicks Btn2 and sends the information “BB” for calculation.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nfhbj.jpg"" alt=""Change ComboBox Values with button selection""></p>

<p>First you have 5 (more or less) menu item and each time you press any (number) buttons (1 to 9 lilke in pos terminal) pressed than new menu appears on the screen.</p>

<p>I thought my TCL file was broken at first but it turns out that if I change the name to 802_11, it works fine with my TCL file. I believe that the error mentioned on line 45 is flagged because it doesn't think I have a protocol called pa3 installed. </p>

0,2,"<p>I want to play a video (mostly .mov with Motion JPEG) in frame by frame mode with changing framerate. I have a function who gives me a framenumber and then I have to jump there. It will be mostly in one direction but can skip a few frames from time to time; also the velocity is not constant.
So I have a timer asking every 40ms about a new framenumber and setting the new position.
My first approach now is with DirectShow.Net (Interop.QuartzTypeLib). Therefore I render and open the video and set it to pause to draw the picture in the graph</p>

<pre><code>    FilgraphManagerClass media = new FilgraphManagerClass();
    media.RenderFile(FileName);
    media.pause();
</code></pre>

<p>Now I will just set a new position</p>

<pre><code>    media.CurrentPosition = framenumber * media.AvgTimePerFrame;
</code></pre>

<p>Since the video is in pause mode it will then draw every requested new position (frame). Works perfectly fine but really slow... the video keeps stuttering and lagging and its not the video source; there are enough frames recorded to play a fluent video.
With some performance tests I found out that the LAV-Codec is the bottleneck here. This is not included directly in my project since its a DirectShow-Player it will be cast through my codec pack I installed on my PC.</p>

<p><strong>Ideas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Using the LAV-Codec by myself directly in C#. I searched but everyone is using DirectShow it seems, building their own filters and not using existing ones directly in the project. </li>
<li>Instead of seeking or setting the time, can I get single frames just by the framenumber and draw them simply?</li>
<li>Is there a complete other way to archive what I want to do?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Background:</h3>

<p>This project has to be a train simulator. We recorded real time videos of trains driving from inside the cockpit and know which frame is what position. Now my C# programm calculates the position of the train in dependence of time and acceleration, gives back the appropriate framenumber and draw this frame. </p>

<hr>

<h3>Additional Information:</h3>

<p>There is another project (not written by me) in C/C++ who uses DirectShow and the avcodec-LAV directly with a similar way I do and it works fine! Thats because I had the idea to use a codec / filter like the avrcodec-lav by myself. But I can't find an interop or interface to work with C#.</p>

However, the Alexa Service Simulator at developer.amazon.com does not seem to be sending the POST data.  I'm using the ""Failed Request Tracing"" feature of IIS to troubleshoot the HTTP POST requests that are being sent via the Service Simulator and the log files show that the HTTP requests sent from the Alexa Service Simulator are coming in on port 443, but the HTTP POST data is completely empty. The POST data should contain the ""amazon echo service request"" object as a JSON string, but it doesn't. When I make the HTTP POST request via Fiddler the POST data contains the ""amazon echo service request"" object as a JSON string and my .NET web api works perfectly. Has anyone else had this problem with the Alexa Service Simulator? What might I be doing wrong?</p>

<p>I am trying to set a font for my label, but it just doesn't appear in my iOS-Simulator when I run the app.</p>

[_favouriteViewer addSubview:_textLabel1];
_textLabel1.font=[_textLabel1.font fontWithSize:25];
</code></pre>

<p>I also added the custom font in my plist:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;key&gt;UIAppFonts&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;Kingthings_Trypewriter_2.ttf&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I saved my custom font in the named asset folder wich I called in:</p>

<pre><code>[_textLabel1 setFont:[UIFont fontWithName:@""assets/fonts/Kingthings_Trypewriter_2.ttf"" size:36]];
</code></pre>

<p>I does not show the font in the simulator. </p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Edit:
I am using AppCode, not Xcode.</p>

<p>Edit2:</p>

<p>Thanks to Ganesh Somani, I used his code to try to find out if my font is correctly added to the project via the Copy Bundle ressources but unfortunately it is still not showing up in the log.</p>

<pre><code>for(NSString *fontfamilyname in [UIFont familyNames])
{
    NSLog(@""Family:'%@'"",fontfamilyname);
    for(NSString *fontName in [UIFont fontNamesForFamilyName:fontfamilyname])
{
    NSLog(@""\tfont:'%@'"",fontName);
}
NSLog(@""---"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Solution:
For some reason I had two .plist files in my project. I put in the following code and now it works:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;key&gt;UIAppFonts&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;""fontName.ttf""&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;

34328178,1,"<p>In the simulator I'm able to get the exact result I want: When I trigger a notification and my simulator phone is locked, then the notification gets pushed to the watch.</p>

<p>This used to work on device (my iPhone 6 on iOS 9.1 and Watch on watchOS 2.0). For some reason it stopped working and I don't know how to debug the problem.</p>

<p>So on device, I make sure that the app is in background by going to home screen and locking the phone and making sure my watch is asleep. When the notification is triggered, nothing happens. When I open up the app, that's when the notifications finally gets triggered. I.E. if I trigger 3 notifications, none of them register until I open the app back into foreground. This is not how it works in simulator (simulator has correct behavior described above).</p>

<p>The notification is triggered by me changing a text object that is stored in my Firebase db. The change calls the sendNotification function. Again, this works perfectly fine in the simulator and used to work on device but for some reason doesn't work anymore.</p>

<p>In app delegate I have:</p>

<pre><code>func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -&gt; Bool {
    UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerUserNotificationSettings(UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: .Alert, categories: nil))

    // Setting up Local Notification
    let assistAction = UIMutableUserNotificationAction()
    assistAction.activationMode = UIUserNotificationActivationMode.Background
    assistAction.identifier = categoryID
    assistAction.title = ""Assist""
    assistAction.authenticationRequired = false
    assistAction.destructive = false

    // Category
    let assistCategory = UIMutableUserNotificationCategory()
    assistCategory.identifier = categoryID
    assistCategory.setActions([assistAction], forContext: UIUserNotificationActionContext.Default)

    // Only way to get this to work with parameter
    let categories = NSSet(object: assistCategory)

    // Settings
    let settings = UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: [.Alert, .Badge, .Sound], categories: categories as? Set&lt;UIUserNotificationCategory&gt;)
    UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerUserNotificationSettings(settings)
    //        UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerForRemoteNotifications()


    return true
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in my view controller I have:</p>

<pre><code>func sendNotification(customerName: String, helpText: String) {
    // Local Notification
    let notification = UILocalNotification()
    notification.alertBody = ""\(customerName) \(helpText)""
    notification.soundName = UILocalNotificationDefaultSoundName
    notification.fireDate = NSDate()
    notification.category = categoryID
    UIApplication.sharedApplication().presentLocalNotificationNow(notification)
    print(""Sent notification"");

<h2>Use case:</h2>

<p>In this example, the car engine will have the follow input parameter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thrust produced (0-100%)</li>
<li>Temperature (-50C to 300C)</li>
<li>NOS (enabled/disabled)</li>
<li>Driving mode (economy / normal / speed)</li>
<li>On/Off</li>
</ul>

<p>These input parameter will alter the following two output parameter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thrust produced (0-150%)</li>
<li>Temperature (-50C to 300C)</li>
</ul>

<p>If for instance the driving mode is set to economy, the maximum thrust which it can output will be e.g. 70%. NOS will also alternate the output somehow. The simulator will have an event handler, were the computed values for thrust and temperature will be announced.</p>

<p>I am working with <strong>Windriver WorkBench 3.3 &amp; VxWorks 6.9 Update3</strong>.</p>

    char* p = (char*)func_ptr;
    for (int i=0; i &lt; PROLOGUE_SIZE; ++i)
        p[i]=m_prologue[i]; // &lt;&lt; prologue is a member array. 
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's call the Real Prologue : Original Prologue;<br>
The Changed Prologue : Changed Prologue;<br>
The One that is placed at Run-Time : Replacement Prologue;  </p>

<p>I get an Exception (signal 11 - Segmentation Fault).<br>
!! I realized it is VxWorks's <code>.text</code> Segment Protection.</p>

<p>So, I created a <code>SimPC based VIP</code> to be my simulator BSP, and <strong>excluded <code>INCLUDE_PROTECT_TEXT</code></strong> (and all it's relevant kernel components)<br>
and run the simulator:<br>
Now, there is no exception! </p>

<h2>Facts</h2>

<ol>
<li>Looking at Memory Browser I see the Changed Prologue Bytes (memory didn't change)!</li>
<li>Printing the buffer to console, prints the Replacement Prologue Bytes values! (Weird)</li>
<li>looking at assembly view (Mega Weird): shows the <strong>Changed Prologue</strong> Hex values but the Original Prologue asm commands (push bp;...) even though the byte value does not match them.</li>
</ol>

<h2>My Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Anyone had any experience with modifying <code>.text</code> segment?</li>
<li>Anyone encountered memory that would not change (without an exception/signal) on simulator, which is not a memory mapped port/volatile ?  </li>
</ul>

<p>I have used this ipn simulator page before (a few months ago) and it was working fine. I was receiving ipn data, sending it back, and getting the confirmation. </p>

<p>Here is the first part of the ipn handler code. It just saves the ipn data before sending it back to have Paypal verify it. However, this is never executed, since the ipn data is never sent from the simulator. The error:
""Cannot GET /webapps/developer/applications/ipn_simulator/"" is displayed when loading the ipn simulator page, before attempting to send anything.</p>

<pre><code>$raw_post_data = file_get_contents('php://input');

// Log initial ipn data, before verification
error_log(date('[Y-m-d H:i e] '). ""Pre validation ipn data:  "".PHP_EOL.$raw_post_data. PHP_EOL.PHP_EOL, 3, LOG_FILE);
</code></pre>

<p>Update: As of Feb 8 2016, 7:49 pm GMT, it is currently working.</p>

<p>Update: Never mind, it worked once, and quit again with same error as in question title.</p>

<p>Is is possible to run android app automation test on it?
Maybe one solution is installing android simulator first, then deploy the app to the simulator through adb, then run the automation script....
However, the linux server is pure text, it does't has any ui library installed. so the simulator can't work.  How to achieve the automation test goal ? any comments are appreciatived.</p>

I'm about to start learning PowerPC architecture and as an example of I've downloaded some reference manuals from NXP website as well as theirs SDK so I can build even bareboard applications. To be precise I'm using virtual host environment. I don't have any board with PowerPC processor on it so I would like to use a simulator for debugging.<br />
At this step I'm a little confused. So, I've built an bareboard application (a 'Hello World' one). And now I'd like to run it with simulator.

For those, who would like to help: I'm using Virtual Host environment for Freescale P1010 processor with e500v2 core, the binary was built with theirs <code>fsl-*</code> utilities.</p>

0,2,"<p>I have a bit of a confusing problem with memory in my iOS app. 
I am using the following function to download about 60 images:</p>

<pre><code>func getDataFromUrl(url:NSURL, completion: ((data: NSData?, response: NSURLResponse?, error: NSError? ) -&gt; Void)) {
    NSURLSession.sharedSession().dataTaskWithURL(url) {  (data, response, error) in //Should already be async
        completion(data: data, response: response, error: error)
        }.resume()
}
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I can tell this is the recommended way of achieving this because it is asynchronous and downloads them one at a time. Unfortunately, somewhere memory isn't being deallocated correctly because I can see my memory continuing to increase and not dropping. The confusing part however is that in the simulator the memory stays relatively flat, as it should. On an iPhone 6, the memory linearly increases and crashes after about 5 minutes. On an iPhone 5s, it increases in a pattern that looks more exponential, and then rapidly drops upon receiving a memory warning, and never crashes. </p>

<p>Here is my code for context:</p>

<pre><code>func cacheImage(teamNum : Int, url : String?) {
    if let urlString = url {
        let url = NSURL(string: urlString)
        getDataFromUrl(url!) { [unowned self] (data, response, error)  in
            guard let data = data where error == nil else { return }
            if let image = UIImage(data: data) {
                self.imageCache.set(value: image, key: ""\(teamNum)"")
            } else {
                print(url)
            }
        }
    }
}

func fetchImageForTeam(teamNumber : Int, fetchedCallback : (UIImage)-&gt;(), couldNotFetch: ()-&gt;()) { // Is already async
    self.imageCache.fetch(key: ""\(teamNumber)"").onSuccess { (image) -&gt; () in
        fetchedCallback(image)
        }.onFailure { (E) -&gt; () in
            couldNotFetch()
    }
}
func getDataFromUrl(url:NSURL, completion: ((data: NSData?, response: NSURLResponse?, error: NSError? ) -&gt; Void)) {
    NSURLSession.sharedSession().dataTaskWithURL(url) {  (data, response, error) in //Should already be async
        completion(data: data, response: response, error: error)
        }.resume()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em></p>

<p>I am aware that downloading 60 images is generally a bad idea, and that I should be more ""lazy"" with my downloading, such that I get the image only just before I need it. For my particular purpose however, the device needs to show the images without significant internet connection, which means it must download them before hand. </p>

<p>The imageCache is Haneke disk Cache <a href=""https://github.com/Haneke/Haneke"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Haneke/Haneke</a></p>

<p>I am additionally aware that I can't hold that many images in memory, and that I should cache them to disk as I download them. This is what I am doing using the disk cache. It should not hold the images in memory, but simply write to disk, and read from disk, when I ask it to. Or do I have a really big understanding gap here?</p>

<p>Will <code>[unowned self]</code> correctly avoid a reference cycle as I thought it would? Or am I misunderstanding the function of the capture list and <code>unowned</code> keyword?</p>

36461252,1,"<p>Basically, the question is to create a simulation for people waiting in line in a bank. There are certain criteria needed such as average waiting time, average number of minutes, average longest waiting time... etc. It also asks to run my program 3 times each a 1000 times (using a for loop). The issue is that each time I run the code, the answers are adding up for some reason and I can't seem to know why. For example, in the last run the number of times the simulation ran should be 1000 times, but instead it added all the previous runs together and gave 3000 times. </p>

<p>Also, all the variables outside the while loop (averageWaitingTime, averageSimulationTime... etc) are giving me wrong answers. It's because, for example, for the average waiting time, it keeps adding the same value of the waiting time. I can't figure out why. </p>

First I used a simple IF-ELSE architecture to do this and it works, now I'm trying to adapt this architecture of IF-ELSE to a state machine.

The state machine from the PRODUCER module it's working correctly, but when I simulate the CONSUMER state machine the outputs doesn't works.</p>

go

<p>can use set console telnet=4444 and telnet to that, no change.  No doubt it is something I dont get about addressing beyond 16 bits but not quite sure where to go to figure this out.</p>

<p>Basically I want to, unless it is a lot of code (thousands of lines of asm) to get some characters to come out of the console, I want to start there to begin to ""see"" something, then build on that.  So if I am close but not quite or if this is not the best peripheral to start with, where to go, they all are in that upper address space.</p>

This assembler was configured for a target of `pdp11-aout'.
</code></pre>

<p>So the syntax is a little goofy/non-standard.  The pdp11 has been supported in binutils for a few releases at least now, wanting to also take advantage of that.  Binary file format for simh was not too hard to figure out, single stepping it is matching the instructions I am wanting and feeding gnu assembler.</p>

<p>Tried on both the apt-got v3.8-1 version of simh pdp11 as well as the github got 4.0 version, same results. using the pdp11 simulator/executable.</p>

<p>Two problems, one I was not waiting for busy.  On init/reset that is okay it is not busy.  I think the kicker was that I halted before it could spit the character out.  When I had the loop it spit out most of the characters.  If I send out one character and halt it doesnt come out, but if I put the wait for busy to go zero after (last thing in notmain()) then that character comes out.</p>

<p>if I change it to this</p>

<pre><code>#define TKS (*((volatile unsigned *)0177560))
#define TKB (*((volatile unsigned *)0177562))

<p>It works quite nicely...thanks for getting me kick started.</p>

<p>Note from a manual:</p>

<pre><code>In addition to the word length constraint on basic memory addressing
space, the uppermost 4K words of address space is always reserved for
UNIBUS 1/0 device registers. In a basic PDP-11/40 memory configura·
tion (without Management) all address references to the uppermost 4K
words of 16-bit address space (170000-177777) are converted to full
18-bit reference5 with bits 17 and 16 always set to 1. Thus, a 16·bit
reference to the 1/0 device register at address 173224 is automatically
internally converted to a full 18-bit reference to the register at address
773224. Accordingly, the basic PDP-11/40 configuration can directly
address up to 28K words of true memory, and 4K words of UNIBUS 1/0
device registers.
</code></pre>

<p>So that answer was right there I didnt look in the right place.</p>

<ul>
<li>16 general purpose registers instead of 8</li>
<li>Additional SSE registers</li>
<li>A no execute (NX) bit to prevent buffer overrun attacks</li>
</ul>

<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>

<p>Historically, the simulations have been performed on 32-bit IA (Intel Architecture) systems.  I am wondering if where (if any) is opportunity to reduce simulation times with 64-bit CPUs: I expect that software should be recompiled to take advantage of 64-bit capability. This type of simulation would not benefit from a MAC (multiply and accumulate) nor does it use floating point calculations.   </p>

<h1>QUESTION</h1>

<p>That being said, is there an Intel 64-bit instruction or capability that offers an appreciable advantage over the 32-bit instructions set that would accelerate simulation (computationally intensive and lengthy 32-BIT algorithms)? </p>

<p>If you have experience implementing simulations and have transitioned from 32 to 64 bit CPUs, please state this in your response (relevant experience is important).  I look forward to insightful responses from the community</p>

<p>I am doing my Final Year Degree and I'm a bit stuck with a small thing. I explain below to see if anyone can help me, because I can't find a solution.</p>

<p>What I'm doing, among other things, it is a Java simulator to simulate oriented students unhealthy habits to obtain good academic. To do this, this simulator what it basically does is to take a random value of a vector (in this case there are two vectors that are two habits to simulate, which should expand with more habits) and then in the corresponding method is set to a <strong>switch</strong> that will value the variable and the time during which the data is sent. Datas are sent to the following URLs:</p>

<p>What happens when values ​​are different are taken, the time of the study or sleep does not print correctly on the screen to perform the second iteration and other clear (the first time it does well), and of course this can lead that the data are not sent by the allotted time. Let me give an example of what I say:</p>

<p>*Pablo Ruiz whose id is 1 study for: <strong>2 minutes</strong><br>
Value field 1 in ThingSpeak, Studio: 1<br>
Simulated and sent to ThingSpeak</p>

<p>Luisa Aguilar whose id is 2 study for: <strong>9 minutes</strong><br>
Value field 1 in ThingSpeak, Studio: 1<br>
Simulated and sent to ThingSpeak*</p>

<p>After 1 minute re-send the data automatically is displayed on screen but the following:</p>

<p>*Pablo Ruiz whose id is 1 study for: <strong>9 minutes</strong><br>
Value field 1 in ThingSpeak, Studio: 1<br>
Simulated and sent to ThingSpeak</p>

<p>Luisa Aguilar whose id is 2 study for: <strong>9 minutes</strong><br>
Value field 1 in ThingSpeak, Studio: 1<br>

        ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt; resultado = servicio.scheduleAtFixedRate(runnable, retraso, periodo, TimeUnit.SECONDS); //ejecuta el runnable cada 60 segundos con un retraso inicial de 0 (para que lo haga directamente)

and in some point of development I needed to implement mouse click from my code (without touching screen) which would triger everytime my
LogInWindow.xaml form loads and I have next issue:</p>

<p>When I run this application on my machine where I am developing it, application works fine, that means -> application is calling my ""CLICK"" 
function and I can see it's triggering button I want, but when I copied .exe(Debug folder) to another machine because I want to test does it work on 
another machine unfortunately I noticed that
the button I am looking for to be triggered, is not trigering on another machine..just on machine where I am developing application, that is weird..</p>

<p>Here is my code:
<em>//This is my function which is doing click somewhere on screen, depending on position of control</em> </p>

<pre><code>[System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport(""user32.dll"")]
    static extern bool SetCursorPos(int x, int y);

    [System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport(""user32.dll"")]
    public static extern void mouse_event(int dwFlags, int dx, int dy, int cButtons, int dwExtraInfo);

public static void LeftMouseClick(int xpos, int ypos)
{
    SetCursorPos(xpos, ypos);
    mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN, xpos, ypos, 0, 0);
    mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP, xpos, ypos, 0, 0);

}
</code></pre>

<p>//Because I want to triger this function everytime my window (form) loads I did this:</p>

<pre><code> private void Window_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
 {

   relativePoint = this.button1.TransformToAncestor(this)
                           .Transform(new Point(0, 0));

   LeftMouseClick((int)relativePoint.X, (int)relativePoint.Y);

    //restOFcode
 }

<p>And somehow It wont triger on any of another machines like its not the same code, really weird.</p>

<p>I am having a similar problem to the above linked discussion, years later, trying to upgrade a working (released) APP from 2009 to the latest iOS 9.3. I had to add a UIViewController to prevent a crash and get the APP to load in the Simulator (XCODE MAC latest, iPhone6). The drawView routine is being called repeatedly to refresh the screen as expected, and things on screen are animated as designed. However NO CLICKS. touchesBegan/Ended never get called. I can start loading up code, but wondering if anything immediate comes to mind since it seems everyone has this problem, or something like it, at some point and it is typically a very simple fix. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update</em>:</strong>  It might be the extra uiViewController messing with the uiView but that's an addition between these APP versions that is required and no longer auto-generated.</p>

<p>Tried setting the uiView as firstResponder:</p>

<pre><code>    - (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder*)coder {
        if ((self = [super initWithCoder:coder])) {
            [self setUserInteractionEnabled:YES];
            [self setMultipleTouchEnabled:YES];
            [self becomeFirstResponder];
</code></pre>

<p>These are the uiView's (glView) touch'ers:</p>

<pre><code>    - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { }
    - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { }
    - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
        int page; [self adjustPage:&amp;page with:0];
        ... }
    - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
        int page; [self adjustPage:&amp;page with:0];
        ... }
</code></pre>

<p>This is my view <code>@interface EAGLView : UIView  &lt;UIAccelerometerDelegate&gt; {</code>.  And added this viewController to the delegate to make it not crash on loading.</p>

<pre><code>    @implementation OpenGLESAppDelegate
    @synthesize window;
    @synthesize glView;
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
        UIViewController* vc = [[UIViewController alloc]initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil];

The image below represents the output of the simulation software (for only one particle). The output is a set of points p0(x,y,z), p1(x,y,z),...,p19(x,y,z). we connect the points to get the curve.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/B9nzs.jpg"" alt=""Please click to see the image""></p>

<p>The x,y,z coordinate must be always > 0 and &lt; max length.
However, in our case which is called Periodic boundary condition we got some points has a value &lt; 0 (red arrow) and some points has a value > max length (green arrow).</p>

<p>If we add the max length to the x,y,z value ( left Box 1 ) then we will move the points into box 1.
and if we subtract the max length from the x,y,z value in Box 2 then we will move the points into box 1.</p>

<p>Actually, this does not solve the problem.</p>

<p>How to solve this issue, please?</p>

<p>Above is an Elevator Simulator Code (before I attempt to make one with a GUI) and my only problem, aside from the obvious beginner flaws, is that I'm having trouble of finding a way to make it so that the program doesn't just end once the user inputs one floor. I at least want the program to run until the user ends it with a command. I'm thinking of using a while loop somewhere but where? Please help and point out anything I should improve in this code.</p>

  <p><strong>What’s changing</strong></p>
  
  <p>We’re making a change on <strong>October 15th, 2016</strong> that will affect apps targeting API version 21 (Android 5.0, Lollipop) or higher that use ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION but don't explicitly have the ""android.hardware.location.gps"" uses-feature. Going forward, these apps will be available to install on devices that don't have GPS hardware. In most cases this won't be an issue since Wi-Fi and Cell-ID based location provides high enough fidelity for the typical operation of these apps. However, any apps that require GPS hardware, such as GPS navigators, should explicitly add the ""android.hardware.location.gps"" uses-feature to their manifest.</p>
  
  <p>If your app requires GPS to function properly and you do not include android.hardware.location.gps in your manifest declaration, your users may have a poor app experience.</p>

<p>Other actions that did not help:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resetting Contents and Settings in the simulator.</li>
<li>Deleting all the simulator devices, and creating them again.</li>
<li>Deleting XCode's cache ""DerivedData"" files. (I believe that is related to project builds, not simulator devices, but just in
case...)</li>
<li>Deleting XCode and Simulator (dragged to trash), and installing Xcode again.</li>
<li>Creating a new simulator device.</li>

<p>What is a less drastic fix, that does not require disabling SIP?</p>

<p>I'm using a ""SimpleWindow"" class as the window, called SimulationWindow, for where the visuals of the simulation is presented. The main class (Named Simulate) does most of the calculations.</p>

<p>I want the clock shown in the SimulationWindow and NOT in the main class. What I mean is that I don't want to use the System.out.println to show the result in the main class Simulation (I know how to do that), but the result needs to be automatically updated every second within the SimulationWindow.</p>

<p>I'm trying to make a function in the SimulationWindow class but can't get it to work. It needs to start counting as soon as the SimulationeWindow opens (when the game starts).</p>

            player.add(new BlueM(w, i, randNbr));
        } else if (randNbr == 1) {
            player.add(new RedM(w, i, randNbr));
        } else if (randNbr == 2) {

0,0,"<p>I've written a very simple simple mpasm program to demonstrate how the hardware stack works on a midrange mpu (pic12F683).  The main loop calls a subroutine which calls another subroutine.  The subroutines do nothing ... they execute a nop and then return. I have program memory and hardware stack windows open.  Single stepping through the program gives the expected results ... program flow is as it should be ... and the first time through, the stack values get populated properly but the stack pointer remains 0 at all times.  When I try a debug build and simulate a second time, the stack values do not reinitialize to zero and I cannot find a way to manually initialize the stack window. </p>

<p>So my question is: is there a way to manually initialize the mplab simulator hardware stack window?  And how can I get the stack pointer to actually give an indication of TOS (top-of-stack)?</p>

0,1,"<p>I am running some simple simulations in NS2.35 using the AODV routing protocol. However, in some scenarios, I notice that, when I run the simulation long enough, AODV REQUEST and REPLY messages are not being sent out and filling up the queues of nodes.</p>

<p>In the .tcl example below I have 3 nodes generating CBR traffic to be sent to the PAN Coordinator. However at some point, route requests and replies are continuously being dropped by node 2 at IFQ level.</p>

<p>Additionally, as illustrated by the following trace snippet, at the end of the simulation (time=10000) the IFQ of node 2 isfilled up with REQUESTS, eventhough there was plenty of time at the end of the simulation to empty the queue.</p>

<p>Any idea what is going on?</p>

<p>Update:
Apparently, at some point REQUEST messages are generated at RTR level but not being sent out and then traffic is dropped because the node didn't receive a route reply in time. Here's a trace example showing this:</p>

<p>Note that in all examples where I encounter this problem, each time a CBR message is generated, the previous route has already expired and a new route has to be found. I think this might be causing a bug somewhere.</p>

0,0,"<p>For electrical net simulation in SV, I'd like to implement a trapezoidal integration method using companion models for caps and inductors.
[<a href=""http://circsimproj.blogspot.nl/2009/07/companion-models.html]"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://circsimproj.blogspot.nl/2009/07/companion-models.html]</a></p>

<p>Some simulation tool vendors provide a SV package allowing to solve for the voltages of a resistive network. See <em>Mixed Signal Verification: Model Development</em> by Simetkosky for a published resolution function.</p>

<p>In order to implement the trapezoidal method, I need to synchronously change equivalent resistors and currents: </p>

<ul>
<li>at the beginning of the simulation, a small time step is chosen, every dynamic element is replaced by a resistor.</li>
<li>the package resolving function calculates new node voltages.</li>
<li>every dynamic element calculates a maximum time step based on tolerance criteria.</li>
<li>the next time step is calculated as the minimum of the requested time steps and a (delayed) update signal is issued.</li>
<li>once the update signal fires, every dynamic element calculates a new equivalent resistance and current..</li>
</ul>

<p>The package uses a nettype with the following structure:</p>

<pre><code>package SVA_pkg;
typedef struct {
    real V;
    real I;
    real R;
}  SVAstruct;
function automatic SVAstruct res_SVA (input SVAstruct driver[]);
   // resolution function
endfunction
nettype SVAstruct SVAnet with res_SVA;
endpackage

// in module
inout SVAnet P;
assign P = '{1 , 0 , 0}; // defines a voltage source
</code></pre>

<p>In order to find a minimum common time step, delaying and then executing the update of the equivalent resistances and currents I have to pass information around.</p>

<p>This boils down to associate to a SVAnet variables with the following requirements: </p>

<ul>
<li>they can be set independently of {V, I, R} </li>
<li>resolution function for {V, I, R} should not react on them</li>
<li>no resolution function for them is needed</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly, direct extension of SVAstruct would not fulfill the first two requirements.</p>

<p>Ideas?</p>

<ul>
<li>Global variables are a possibility, but I would like to see a more automatic way to communicate among connected SVAnets.</li>
<li>Creating a class or using a substructure on which the resolution works come to my mind but are beyond my programming skills.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>observations</code> and <code>packs</code> are set to an integer. </p>

<pre><code>   award  prob
1   Nick  0.5
2   Alex  0.4
3    Sam  0.1
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>droptable</code> takes a similar dataframe :   </p>

<pre><code>    qty   prob
1   10 0.1355
2   12 0.3500
3   15 0.2500
4   20 0.1500
5   25 0.1000
6   50 0.0080
... continued
</code></pre>

<p><code>cardnum</code> also takes an integer. </p>

<p>It's fine to run this multiple times and assign the output to a variable and then rbind and order, but what I'd really like to do is feed a master function a dataframe that contains which cards it needs to provision and which lookup and droptables it should pull against for each card a la:</p>

<pre><code>  card      lookup       droptable
1    1       char1       chardrops
2    2       char1       chardrops
3    3       char2            &lt;NA&gt;
4    4     credits            &lt;NA&gt;
5    5     credits     creditdrops
6    6 abilityMats abilityMatDrops
7    7 abilityMats abilityMatDrops
</code></pre>

<p>It's probably never going to be more than 20 cards...so I'm willing to take the speed of a for loop, but I'm curious how the SO community would approach this problem.</p>

<p>Here's what I put together thus far:</p>

<pre><code>mySimAllCards &lt;- function(observations, packs, cards){

    full &lt;- data.frame()

    for(i in i:length(cards$card)){

        tmp &lt;- mySimAnyCard(observations, packs, cards[i,2], cards[i,3], i)
        full &lt;- rbind(full, tmp)

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>which trips over</p>

<pre><code> Error in `[.default`(lookup, , ""award"") : incorrect number of dimensions 
</code></pre>

<p>I can work through the issues above, but is there a better approach to consider?</p>

<p>There are a couple of paragraphs explaining this, that are of not much help. At any rate, this here prints a formatted string, along with some string parameters (stored in s1 and s2) and integer parameters (where are they stored?). </p>

<p>I have two arrays stored in memory. I have personally executed instructions upon them and now i want to print them. How do i supply on such a formatted string these two integers (which are double words, ie. needing 8 bytes to be stored)? The help material doesn't explain. </p>

<p>This is the code that i have managed to create up to this point (heavily commented):</p>

<pre><code>....
dadd $s4, $zero, $zero                  ; i = 0
printOutput:                                    ; print results from the 2 arrays
        beq $s4, 960, end                       ; if (i = size = 960 / 8) goto end
        dadd $s1, $s4, $s2                      ; full address of 1st array
        dadd $s0, $s4, $s3                      ; full address of 2nd array

        daddi $a3, $zero, printString           ; address ofstring to be printed stored in $a3
        ld $v0, 0($s1)                          ; $v0 will be used to print 1st array[i]. Is this right?
        ld $v1, 0($s2)                          ; $v1 will be used to print 2nd array[i]. Is this right? Which register to use for supplying a formatted string to print integers? It is not explained anywhere! 
        dadd $14, $zero, $a3                    ; print string. $14 is the register to syscall instructions. But i'm just guessing with this. I really don't know how it should handle. I just supplied $a3 because it seems more intuitive.

        syscall 5                               ; prints ouput (on the MEM stage)
        daddi $s4, $s4, 8                       ; i++
        j printOutput
end:
</code></pre>

<p>If anyone knows how to do this, i would be very greatful if he/she could share. There's not any examples on this anywhere. Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>With the help of Michael and by trial and error i found the main cause of the problem. The sequence where we supply the labels for the output string and other memory addresses is very sensitive. By trial and error i found that we must obey the following order:</p>

<pre><code>.data
format_string .asciiz ""%d and %i etc..""
start_address .space  4
syscallArg1   .space  4                   ; 1st parameter to syscall 5
syscallArg2   .space  4                   ; 2nd parameter to syscall 5
---other labels go here---
.text
---code---
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we have to supply to <code>$14</code> the start_address label, which must not contain anything (just some available empty space). Before this one the formatted string must go and after this one the arguments to the <code>syscall 5</code> must lie. Other labels can go afterwards, or before all those.</p>

So I basically created a simulator for the playoffs (3 rounds, first is best of 5, next two are best of 7). And I can see how much a SP would hurt the team if he pitches every third game and he decreases the chance of winning by 10%. </p>

<p>To make sure I did this write, I first ran my simulation without any adjustment so every game both teams would have a 50% chance of winning... (a team would therefore have a 12.5% chance of winning the world series in a 3 round playoff) however, I was getting consistently higher than 12.5. </p>

<p>I have a feeling the problem was with the Rnd function, so I played with that a bit (added a function, tried to vary the time ect.), now my simulation comes out to be &lt;12.5%. I then tried to trouble shoot and noticed that in each round was not being won 50% of the time... which was the case each time I re-ran the simulation (Like round 1 would have a 47% success then round two 51% then round three 58%... then the next run would return 46%, 52%, 59%. </p>

<p>On a first look you probably can't see any problem, but let me tell you one additional fact: if a Star reaches a certain density (Schwarzschildradius > Radius), it should form a BlackHole. So how can I tell the Simulation to swap the Star instance with a BlackHole one? I could add a Simulation instance to each body, where they themselves can then modify the bodies array, but there has to be a better way!</p>

<p>Another approach could be, to instead let Planet, Star and BlackHole be subclasses of a new class BodyType, of which Body would then hold an instance.</p>

<p>What do you think? How would you solve this in a nice and clean way? Any help is appreciated!</p>

45236540,1,"<p>I'm new to OMNeT++, and I'm trying to link Crypto++5.6.5 to OMNeT++5.1.1. The only way that OMNeT++ seems to allow me to link the Crypto++ library is using the static version of the Crypto++ library like I describe below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Right clicking on Project->Properties->OMNeT++->Makemake->Option, from ""Target"" I choose ""Static Library(.lib or .a)""</li>
<li>From ""Compile"" I choose the directory where cryptlib.lib is located (C:\cryptopp565\Win32\DLL_Output\Debug)</li>
<li>From ""Link"" I choose the additional library ""cryptlib"". (The actual library file is ""cryptlib.lib"")</li>
</ul>

<p>All my encryption errors go away (so it seems like my crypto library is linked) and I can run the simulator, but the problem is when I run the simulation, the simulation hasn't updated from when I previously ran the simulator. I know I'm seeing the simulator run my previous (old) version of my project, from before I included a static library, because my old debug output plays even though I change the debug output using ""EV&lt;&lt;..."".</p>

<p>I don't think putting encryption into a simulator is a great idea, BUT this static-library-executing-old-simulator problem seems to happen regardless of what library I connect. So long as I select ""Static Library(.lib or .a)"" from the Target makemake page, even if I don't include a static library, the simulator doesn't update. When I go back to ""Target Type""->""Executable"" and build/run the simulator (and get rid of my link &amp; compile to cryptlib), the most up-to-date project gets simulated, but my crypto library isn't linked.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me fix my settings so the OMNeT++ simulator runs my most recently built project when I target a static library?</p>

<p>Is this problem only limited to the simulator or will it also appear in a physical ipad?</p>

<p>Longer:
Using Xcode 9 beta 5 
(simulator version listed as: Version 10.0 (SimulatorApp-829.3 )
If I make just one change to the standard single-view application viewController.swift file, adding a 
print(""*** viewDidLoad() has executed at (Date())"")
inside of viewDidLoad, then build &amp; run.
App runs in the simulator.
I see the expected print result in the Xcode console</p>

<p>while app still runs in the simulator, I return home (shift-cmd-H) and then to the first icon home screen (another shift-cmd-H)
I double tap home button (twice rapidly shift-cmd-H) to get the app switcher.
I swipe up on my running still-running app.
I get a ""Terminated due to signal 9"" debugger message under the line that printed above, as expected.</p>

<p>If, in the still-running simulator, I double-click the icon for the app I just quit, the app loads, as expected, BUT…
-   The console doesn't clear
-   There is no new ""*** viewDidLoad()…"" statement, (I added Date() to the printout to verify it wasn't simply overwriting the prior statement). There's no new statement at all.</p>

<p>Am I experiencing a simulator bug, or do I have it wrong to think that swiping an app up from the iOS App Switcher will terminate the app AND remove it from memory so a subsequent app load will execute viewDidLoad anew?</p>

<p>Now I am able to create only one falling drop at one time. Have anyone some idea how to ,,generate"" another drops (many at the same time) and how to implement that change of X direction where i putted ""???""marks in comment? It works well only when im refreshing the browser.

I have tried all options:  manually resizing, setting to 100%, zoom on/off, etc.  None of the options allow me to expand the simulator past the visible bounds of my screen.  It won't let you drag the corner past the bounds.  So when you press COMMAND+S to take the screenshot, it winds up to be lower res than what ItunesConnect needs. </p>

0,1,"<p>so recently, we've been assigned to code multiple circles that act like robots in a GUI interface. Basically, a robot simulator.</p>

<p>I've got the code to spawn in multiple circles that can act like robots. </p>

<p>This is my current code for detecting wall collision between the robot and the end of the square:</p>

<pre><code>private void checkCollisions(double maxX, double maxY) {

for (ListIterator&lt;Ball&gt; slowIt = balls.listIterator(); slowIt.hasNext();) {
        Ball b1 = slowIt.next();
        // check wall collisions:
        double xVel = b1.getXVelocity();
        double yVel = b1.getYVelocity();
        if ((b1.getCenterX() - b1.getRadius() &lt;= 0 &amp;&amp; xVel &lt; 0)
                || (b1.getCenterX() + b1.getRadius() &gt;= maxX &amp;&amp; xVel &gt; 0)) {
            b1.setXVelocity(-xVel);
        }
        if ((b1.getCenterY() - b1.getRadius() &lt;= 0 &amp;&amp; yVel &lt; 0)
                || (b1.getCenterY() + b1.getRadius() &gt;= maxY &amp;&amp; yVel &gt; 0)) {
            b1.setYVelocity(-yVel);
        }
        for (ListIterator&lt;Ball&gt; fastIt = balls.listIterator(slowIt.nextIndex()); fastIt.hasNext();) {
            Ball b2 = fastIt.next();

            final double deltaX = b2.getCenterX() - b1.getCenterX() ;
            final double deltaY = b2.getCenterY() - b1.getCenterY() ;
            if (colliding(b1, b2, deltaX, deltaY)) {
                bounce(b1, b2, deltaX, deltaY);
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The </p>

<pre><code>b1.setXVelocity(-xVel);  

b1.setYVelocity(-yVel); 
</code></pre>

<p>are the main bits that make the circle bounce back from the wall. However, instead of this, I want the ball to detect the wall and rotate 90 degrees rather than bounce back form the wall like a bouncing ball. </p>

<p>Any help will be fully appreciated or a working piece of code that ca do this for me. I have an AraryList of all the balls called 'balls'.</p>

<p>If needed, I can give source code.</p>

<p>This is what I have so far. But I need each ball to have a sensor attached to them detecting if there a wall ahead. </p>

0,2,"<p>i have to create a traffic simulator, i want to move a car (picturebox) while the traffic light is not red and have it stopped when it is red, at the point of the traffic light.
The traffic lights are 3 pannels changing color.</p>

<p>My problem is that my car does not stop when it meets the red traffic light. I have tried the ""pictureBox.Location.X"" and the ""pictureBox.Left"" but it just doesn't work, the pictureBox just goes on moving.
I have also tried throwing a messageBox when the car meets the traffic light just to see if the ""pictureBox.Location.X"" is working but still nothing. Seems like it does not recognize the function.</p>

<p>I have tried to make the traffic light both with panels and pictureboxes but still the same.    </p>

48551866,1,"<p>Sorry for how long this is. It's a mystery to me, looking for any pointers anyone might have.</p>

<p>There seems to be a bug in the iOS simulator in how UIGestureRecognizers work and pass along touch points that persists until the simulator is restarted. Even killing the app and restarting it within the simulator does not fix it. The only way to fix it (temporarily) is to actually exit the simulator entirely and restart it.</p>

<p>I've got an SKView subclass inside of a UIViewController subclass. The SKView subclass occupies the bottom section of the UIViewController, with the top section containing some buttons and other controls. The game involves taps and pans, managed by UIGestureControllers that are owned by the SKView subclass that owns an SKScene subclass.</p>

<p>After arbitrary periods of time, the gestures stop working correctly. None of them are recognized correctly within the view owned by the SKScene. If I click outside the SKView and in the parent UIViewController, then they show up, but the coordinates are all wrong. It also gets state wrong - sometimes the UIPanGestureRecognizer thinks that there are two fingers pressed instead of only one. The UIPanGestureRecognizer is similarly off. There is no recognizable pattern to this behavior - it just starts all of the sudden.</p>

<p>Here is the relevant code for initializing the SKView and it's scene:</p>

<pre><code>    SKView * _gameView = [[SKView alloc] initWithFrame : gameRect];
    _gameView.clipsToBounds = YES;
    // _gameView.scene is an SKScene subclass
    CGSize gameSize = CGSizeMake(_gameView.bounds.size.width,
                                 _gameView.bounds.size.width);
    _scene = [[GameScene alloc] initWithSize : gameSize];
    // Present the scene.
    [_gameView presentScene : _scene];
    [self.view addSubview : _gameView];
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code inside the SKScene subclass that registers the UIGestureControllers:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) initializeGestureRecognition : (SKView *) view
{
    UIPanGestureRecognizer * panRecognizer = [[UIPanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget : self action : @selector (handlePanGesture:)];
    UITapGestureRecognizer * tapRecognizer = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget : self action : @selector (handleTapGesture:)];
    panRecognizer.delegate = self;
    tapRecognizer.delegate = self;
    panRecognizer.maximumNumberOfTouches = 2;
    [tapRecognizer requireGestureRecognizerToFail : panRecognizer];
    [view addGestureRecognizer : panRecognizer];
    [view addGestureRecognizer : tapRecognizer];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code for the UIPanGestureRecognizer's handlePanGesture delegate:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) handlePanGesture : (UIPanGestureRecognizer*) panRecognizer
{
    self.deltaInView = [panRecognizer translationInView : self.view];
    self.deltaInScene = CGPointMake(deltaInView.x, -(deltaInView.y));
    if (UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged == panRecognizer.state)
        {
            self.panTouchPoint = [self getPanTouchPoint : panRecognizer];
        }
    else if (UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded == panRecognizer.state)
        {
            // Other non-relevant stuff here
        }
}

- (CGPoint) didGetPanTouchPoint : (UIPanGestureRecognizer*) panRecognizer
{
    CGPoint touchPoint = CGPointMake(0.0, 0.0);
    if (2 == panRecognizer.numberOfTouches)
    {
        CGPoint tempPoint = [self calculateSafeCentroidPointFromRecognizer : panRecognizer];
        touchPoint = [self convertPointFromView : tempPoint];
    }
    else if (1 == panRecognizer.numberOfTouches)
    {
        CGPoint tempPoint = [panRecognizer locationOfTouch : 0

        touchPoint = [self convertPointFromView : tempPoint];
    }
    return touchPoint;
}


- (CGPoint) calculateSafeCentroidPointFromRecognizer : (UIGestureRecognizer*) recognizer
{
    CGPoint thisPointInView = [recognizer locationOfTouch : 0
                                                   inView : self.view];
    CGPoint thatPointInView = [recognizer locationOfTouch : 1
                                                   inView : self.view];
    CGPoint safePoint = [self calculateCentroidPoint : thisPointInView
                                         secondPoint : thatPointInView];
    return safePoint;
}


CGPoint CalculateCentroidPoint(const CGPoint * thisPoint,
                               const CGPoint * thatPoint)
{
    CGPoint centroidPoint = CGPointMake((thisPoint-&gt;x + thatPoint-&gt;x) / 2.0),
                                        (thisPoint-&gt;y + thatPoint-&gt;y) / 2.0));
    return centroidPoint;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the code for the UITapGestureRecognizer's handleTapGesture delegate:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) handleTapGesture : (UIGestureRecognizer *) gestureRecognizer
{
    if (gestureRecognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded)
    {
        UITapGestureRecognizer * tapRecognizer = (UITapGestureRecognizer*) gestureRecognizer;
        CGPoint viewTouchLocation = [tapRecognizer locationOfTouch : 0
                                                            inView : self.view];
        CGPoint sceneTouchLocation = [self convertPointFromView : viewTouchLocation];
        // Do other stuff here
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One interesting thing to note is that BOTH the tap and pan gesture recognizers are incorrect. It isn't one or the other. This leads me to believe that there is some systemic problem. </p>

<p>(Or, more likely, I've mucked something up.)</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Its fairly easy to generate a random number with a known variance and mean.
I would like to get something that lets me submit an array of cumulants (or moments) </p>

<pre><code>Example: (ci = cumulent, mi = momemts)
  c1 = m1 or ‘mean’
  c2 = m2 − m1 = σ2 or ‘variance’ (σ = standard deviation)
  c3 = m3 − 3*m1*m2 + 2*m3 or ‘skewness’
  c4 = m4 − 3*m2 − 4*m1*m3 + 12*m1*m2 − 6*m1 or ‘kurtosis' 
</code></pre>

<p>So I would like a function, f, that takes a bunch of ci values and produces a single data point whose array of historical values maintains the specified cumulants. </p>

<pre><code> y(i) = f(c1,c2,c3,..., and optionally [y(i-1), y(i-2), ...])

0,1,"<p>I would like to change my current Java project to distribute work through Apache Spark. 
I am building a simulator for sports outcomes - currently the project looks a bit like this:</p>

<p>Controller class
Simulator class
GameState class</p>

<p>The controller class takes care of all the user input and edits the GameState.
The simulator's run method is called whenever the GameState changes and works out the new outcomes.
I have already profiled and optimized, as well as parallelising the simulator class onto all threads on my CPU but it is still too slow when doing many simulations - hence the desire to scale up CPU cores.</p>

<p>I'm trying to learn the basics of Map Reduce and Spark and I understand the basic word count example. Is there a slightly more complex set of examples I can work from? I suppose I need to find a way of broadcasting the GameState to each node, running the simulation and then reporting back. </p>

<p>But can I wrap an instance of the GameState class as an RDD? Can I wrap the simulator's run method as some sort of mapping function? I'm not sure what spark is capable of in these cases..</p>

0,0,"<p>I am storing persistent data in my application using NSCoder like below:</p>

<pre><code>class UserNotification: NSObject, NSCoding {

    var message: String!

    init(message: String) {
        self.message = message
    }

    required convenience init(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
        let message = aDecoder.decodeObject(forKey: ""message"") as! String

        self.init(message: message)
    }

    func encode(with aCoder: NSCoder) {
        aCoder.encode(message, forKey: ""message"")
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is how they are loaded into the application:</p>

if (defaults.object(forKey: ""userNotifications"") != nil) {
        let decoded = defaults.object(forKey: ""userNotifications"") as! Data
        let decodedUserNotifications = NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveObject(with: decoded as Data) as! [UserNotification]
        userNotifications = decodedUserNotifications

<p>I also have included a way for the user to clear all the saved data. For clearing, I have implemented:</p>

<pre><code>let newListData = NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: userNotifications)
let defaults = UserDefaults.standard
defaults.set(newListData, forKey: ""userNotifications"")
defaults.synchronize()
</code></pre>

<p>All user notification objects are stored in a globally accessible array:</p>

<pre><code>userNotifications = [UserNotification]()
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to make sure that all the persistent data is removed once the user has cleared them. I was looking through the folder of my simulator (~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices) in order to find the persistent data and to see if it gets removed, but I have not managed to find it anywhere.</p>

<p>Everything seems to work when running the application (saving data, erasing it etc.) but I would like to make sure that all data get erased correctly on the device. There are some thumbnails being saved and therefore I want to make sure it really becomes erased and not taking up unnecessary space.</p>

<p>So my question is where the data is stored when using NSCoder? I am able to find locally stored images from using FileManager, but the encoded data is nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Often times, code looks slightly different for the different form-factors of Apple products. Therefore I came up with the following switch case (see below...) to distinguish programmatically between devices.</p>

<p>The Simulator is its own Device ! And I need to uncomment/comment in each and every switch-case if I change to a Simulator-target with different form-factor !</p>

<pre><code>switch UIDevice.current.modelName {

    // Here there is still the need to uncomment/comment the Devices.Simulator
    // for any new form-factor that is being simulated....

50279691,2,"<p>I run the Xcode Simulator on its own for web development testing. When Simulator starts up, it always boots up the iPhone X (iOS 11.3) because it was running when I last quit the simulator, because I can't figure out how to shut down the phone.</p>

<p>I can't hit the (virtual) power and volume buttons at the same time in the simulator (as one would do on a real phone) and for some reason the Settings > General area doesn't have the option to ""Shut Down."" I can restart the device from the Simulator's ""Hardware"" menu but there does not seem to be an option for shutting down the phone (even with extra keyboard modifiers held).</p>

<p>Have I missed anything or is this just not possible?</p>

<p><strong>Clarifications:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm only running the simulator to use Safari on various platforms. There is no program instance to deactivate. Xcode is not running (or doesn't need to be running after the Simulator is launched from the Xcode menu). I have also tried launching, say, an iPhone 6S simulation from a compiled Xcode project but this only launches that hardware for that run. Next time I go directly into the Simulator, it remembers which hardware simulations were running and launches those.</li>
<li>I can select a different piece of hardware from the Hardware menu (e.g., iPhone 6S) but now I have <strong>two</strong> simulations running, which is resource intensive (and undesirable). I can shutdown the 6S because I can hold down the (virtual) power button to instruct the OS to perform its shutdown routine. But I can't shut down the iPhone X because there's no way (that I can find) to command the OS to shutdown like I can with anything else. The software method (in Settings) doesn't show in the simulator (for some strange reason) and the hardware method requires hitting two buttons at the same time. The net result is, now that I launched an iPhone X once, I always have to simulate an iPhone X + whatever I'm actually testing against.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workaround Found</strong></p>

<p>When Simulator is launched on its own (not though an Xcode project) it will re-launch the last simulation that was activated from the Hardware menu <em>if</em> it's left running. So if I launch something new, and then leave both it and the iPhone X simulator running, When I quit Simulator it will relaunch with the next time with new hardware, not the iPhone X.</p>

<p>I'd still be interested in any method to just tell the iPhone X hardware to shut down (if such a thing exists) as I'm often having to flip between hardware simulations and it would good to be able to do that without having to relaunch to get rid of iPhone X.</p>

<p>I've created a Player class and a Deck class to hand their respective roles but I'm stumped as for how to bring them together in a cohesive way. I need an environment where the hands of the game can play out. I thought of just handling this all in the main but it seems like that would be a mess. </p>

    deque&lt;int&gt; hand; // the players hand can hold an entire deck of cards.

};

<p>However when I open my project in Xcode 9, there is no error and my app works perfectly. 
I searched for this problem and I tried everything that other people suggested on stackoverflow. From checking all the storyboard object and constraint connections, to making sure that the Classes are right and Inherit Module From Target is checked. I also tried „Erase All Content And Settings“ in Simulator and deleting the DerivedData folder. Removing the backgroundImage in Storyboard and code didn’t help, because then I got the same error but with another object from the same ViewController. </p>

<p>Does anyone have the same issue and found a solution? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> When I add a new View Controller and set it to ""is initial ViewController"", the view does load in Simulator. As soon as I add a swift file and set the Class in Interface Builder for that new ViewController, I get the Unknown Class warning. And when I add a label or any object, I get: Unknown class AND NSUnknownKeyException. So there's definitely nothing wrong with a specific ViewController or object. If someone had the same problem, please help me. I can't do anything anymore with this project :(</p>

     uint32_t nodeIdr=socket-&gt;GetNode()-&gt;GetId();
     while ((packet = socket-&gt;Recv ()))
     {
        uint8_t buf[1300];

<p>When I do this, the receive callback is called, but it seems to be a loopback transmission. If I change the ueNode.Get() the program SIGSEGV:</p>

<p>In a Run Script <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38010494/is-it-possible-to-toggle-software-keyboard-via-the-code-in-ui-test"">from this stackoverflow answer</a>, I am injecting a plist key ""ConnectHardwareKeyboard"" with value false to disable the hardware keyboard connection which is enabled by default when launching a simulator:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HKbrQ.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hardware -> Keyboard -> Connect Hardware Keyboard</a></p>

<p>This script will set the value correctly for the existing simulators (iPad Air 2), but when the tests are executing in parallel, multiple clones of iPad Air 2 are created and the plists for the clones is not a clone from the original device. No flag is set in the cloned devices plists at all, but Hardware -> Keyboard -> Connect Hardware Keyboard is shown as selected.</p>

<p>This is causing my UI Tests to fail, because the keyboard is missing when I'm trying to dismiss the keyboard after typing test into a textField.</p>

<p>I have looked through many posts on stackoverflow and Apple developer forums to try and resolve this issue but have not found anything. This must be a problem for other people... has anyone out there had this same problem and/or found a solution?</p>

<p>Also, all options under the Run menu are greyed out (e.g. Start Without Debugging, Start Debugging, etc)</p>

<p>My conclusion is that it's because the simulator requires 386 architecture but this is not listed as a supported architecture: <strong>option > iOS Build > Supported Architectures</strong></p>

<p>I've tried adjusting the SDK, Deployment Target, and  Minimum System Version, but unable to see 386 as an architecture option or show the Run button.</p>

<p>I reckon I'm missing something really simple here, but I can't figure out what. Any suggestions?</p>

0,0,"<p>I am making a light simulator where each beam of light is individually calculated.
I have a problem though:</p>

<p>When I make a beam of light shoot out that has a rgba color of 0 0 0 0.01 it draws a black beam of light instead of doing nothing.  I am wondering how to draw it by only making the background brighter.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TSFxy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This is a img of it</a></p>

<p>Currently light shoots out of a light source as a white beam then hits a ball which only red deflects off of it.  Then that beam shoots into a ball which only deflects blue light... BUT since the beam was red (and red and blue do not share rgb colors) I made it turn black.  But when that beam shoots of it draws black light over my white light as seen in the img.</p>

<p>I have tried to draw each of the rgb seperatly like so:</p>

<pre><code>c.beginPath();
c.arc(x, y, size, 0, 2*Math.PI);
c.fillStyle = ""rgba("" + red + "", 0, 0, 0.01)"";
c.fill();
c.fillStyle = ""rgba(0, "" + green + "", 0, 0.01)"";
c.fill();
c.fillStyle = ""rgba(0, 0, "" + blue + "", 0.01)"";
c.fill();
</code></pre>

<p>I'd found something about using <code>-L</code> option of <code>g++</code> compiler,  but as I understand it, it only works with static archive libraries (<code>.a</code>) or shared objects (<code>.so</code>).</p>

<p>As long as those libraries are supposed to be used as Arduino libraries, I don't think I should leave those files in their directories, and also, I don't want to go there end recompile every time some minor change is made.</p>

<p>There is any way to compile these files without manually adding each <code>.cpp</code> file? Considering that maybe not all file must be included (because my final goal is to build a simulator). Maybe something like:</p>

<p><code>./main$ g++ -o test.run -I./../src -L./../src/ main.cpp</code></p>

<p>Also, any tips on which compilation tags might be useful in this case?</p>

<hr>

<p>PS.: I can handle with recompiling at every change, with <code>make</code> it's ok, but since I'm going to use some preprocessor directives, I don't  feel comfortable with it, cuz sometimes it must be ready to run in arduino, sometimes in PC;</p>

<p>PPS.: My final goal is to build an <a href=""https://github.com/UFABCRocketDesign/Simulator/commit/8fd92c7b4318d374db3161867dd095b21813fb6b"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">arduino simple port and software simulator</a>, which is already working, and that's the main reason of I'm afraid to let those additional files there, the libraries must keep compiling at arduino, and must stay in the arduino include path.</p>

The office is usually open from <strong>8.00am to 6.00pm.</strong>
The function would give me timestamps when the door was opened and when the door was closed ( in Timestamps ). 
<strong>The door takes 10 seconds to close.</strong></p>

<p>So I want to create a function which I would randomly call between <strong>8.00am to 6.00pm.</strong> That function would give me timestamps of when the door was opened and closed.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate if you can suggest me a different approach.</p>

<p>UPDATED : Assume that the door will remain close with a <code>Sensor_Status : 0</code> until that function is called.

0,1,"<p>In developing an app on Xcode, I have an issue where alignment of certain labels/image views is only correct on the simulator when the 'View as:' option in the storyboard matches the same device type.</p>

<p>I am creating an app which contains a square near the middle of the screen (an image view) and within it, a bunch of smaller image views arranged in a a circle.</p>

<p>If I go to the storyboard and view the screen as a particular device (i.e iPhone Xs), when I run the same device on the simulator (also iPhone Xs), all is perfectly aligned. If I then go back to the storyboard viewing the screen as an alternate device (i.e. iPhone 8), and rerun the simulator (still iPhone Xs), the alignments are off.</p>

<p>The square (which is done using autolayout in the storyboard) looks fine throughout, whereas the smaller image views, which are created in code on the fly, are the ones that are awry. Their positions are based on the centre of the square, which is calculated as self.squareView.center.x and self.squareView.center.y. These calculations seem to be based on what screen is in the storyboard, and not the screen in the simulator.</p>

<p>Has anyone had any issues with similar or know how this could be resolved?</p>

<p>Code below:</p>

<pre><code>let radius = 1.4 // these will be arranged in a circle within the square view.
let angleStep = Float(2.0 * Double.pi) / Double(arrayOfImages.count) // arrayOfImages.count will be a number between 5 and 7.
let yPos: Float = cosf(angleStep * radius)
let xPos: Float = sinf(angleStep * radius)

// The below is to determine the midpoint of the view that I am having the issue with:

let setCenter = CGPoint(x: self.squareView.center.x + CGFloat(xPos), y: self.squareView.center.y + CGFloat(yPos)


// Then the code to arrange the image view:

arrayOfImages[i].frame = CGRect(x:CGFloat(xPos), y:CGFloat(yPos), width: 30, height: 30)
arrayOfImages[i].center = setCenter

This used to work fine before but I stopped working on the app for a year and Xcode updated since. You can find screenshots of the issue below.</p>

<p>I tried using an other version of Xcode (11 beta). I tried deleting everything Xcode and Simulator related and reinstalling. I tried disabling every fancy effect on my dice nodes but nothing seems to have an impact, the issue really seems to come from the simulator rendering. </p>

<p>As anyone ever encountered a similar issue? Any help on how to fix it would be appreciated as I use Fastlane Snapshot to generate new screenshots when I release. </p>

0,0,"<p>I have set up code to respond to PayPal IPN calls and it used to work, but for some reason broke recently. (within the last month). I went to back to test it with the PayPal IPN simulator and am now seeing some very strange behavior. If I point the simulator at the responder on my website and choose web_accept, with no changes to any other fields, and then hit Send IPN, it comes back saying the ""IPN was sent and the handshake was verified.""</p>

<p>However, if I fill in all the fields as if it were a real purchase, and then hit Send IPN, I get the message, ""IPN was not sent, and the handshake was not verified. Review your information."" If I go through and look at the database and errors that are logged, my server carries out the code I have set to enter the person into the group, as if they had paid and the transaction is recorded, just like I want it to be. This code only fires if the transaction from PayPal is received and PayPal sends back the VERIFIED code. What gives?</p>

<p>I dug through Stack Overflow and have tried all the suggestions and anything else I can find. No luck. I have tried going live just to see if it's a bug in the IPN simulator, but transactions are not being processed.</p>

<p>I think that means the simulator can correctly handle the c progrom using c standard library (newlibc implementation).</p>

<p>My brain get stuck at this point. Since the simulator is reading only the assembly instructions(mapping into binary), for handling newlibc, does it mean the simulator is able to handle all the assembly instructions compile from the newlibc?</p>

<p>If I try to implement my own simulator, how can I know what are the assembly instructions that I need to include?</p>

<p>Also, I want my simualtor to be able to handle system call ex, printf() -> write() which would be really useful.</p>

<p>But how can I run a program compiled for riscv and call the host x86 machine write() syscall to print information on the screen?</p>

<p>What actually happens is the simulator freezes and becomes unresponsive (it's impossible to click on anything, use the keyboard, turn it off using the rendered power button; you need to kill it using Cmd+W, or restart using Hardware menu). When it happens, all following tests in the given file fail with a Timeout error.</p>

<p>Then, when we're starting a new test suite (new spec file), a new simulator is opened by Detox and the tests carry on... until this happens again.
I've seen it happens 2 times in the test suite, resulting in 3 simulators being open (2 of them frozen).</p>

<p>when I run (ionic cordova run android) the app load in the simulator but it is not working accordingly which means when I enter users information and click submit the information is not loaded in the database but when I do the same thing in web(ionic serve) it works just fine and I could be able to register a new user into the database. I am using laravel for my backend. Please help me to solve this problem.</p>

<p>we have a ship simulator(client) and Modbus controller(Server). <strong>Our goal is to develop an emulator(like controller)</strong> on my PC. But we have no information about the client(simulator). </p>

<p><strong>Progress</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly we checked the actual outputs from the controller(server). There are 7 different variables like engine telegraph, rudder angle and so no. </li>
<li>Secondly, I checked the register numbers of the controller, which store command values. <strong>It was from 0 to 7.</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>Polling server with Modpoll software installed server:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZfzUE.png"" alt=""screen1""></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I checked the register type. It was a holding register </p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a script to develop a Server like a controller with pymodbus Server. I can not only write specific values on the holding register from 0 to 7, but also there are proper handshake and responses to the simulator(client)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Client sends a request for reading with register numbers from 256</strong>. <strong>It means that my Server responds with zero values not with the command values written on the registers from 0 to 7.</strong> But the problem is that the simulator(client) shows the changes of the parameters on its Graphical user interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>Screen shot from wireshark - it shows that clinet(simulator) sends a request with register nuumber from 246:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TU229.png"" alt=""screen2""></p>

<ul>
<li>Client sends a request not only for reading but also for writing and the writing request overwrite the values written by Server (PC). </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>how is it possible that the simulator receives the command signal by requesting different register numbers? client must send a request with register numbers from 0 to receive command signals.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>I cannot understand why the client writes first before reading values from Server.</strong> This read request overwrites the values written by Server (pc). The Server (controller or pc) is to send a command signal to the simulator. I have no idea why the simulator first writes some values on sever and read it. </p></li>

<p>From the class defined above, we can instantiate <code>Earth</code>, <code>Venus</code>, and the <code>Sun</code>. Mass is given in units of kg, positions in meters, velocity in m/s, acceleration in m/s^2. The Sun is initially located at the origin; the initial position of Earth is completely in the x-direction (with its velocity directed in the y-direction, tangential ...); and the initial position of Venus is completely in the y-direction (with is velocity directed in the x-direction). The values used are <a href=""https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=venus%20orbital%20speed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">obtained and converted via wolframalpha</a>.</p>

<p>Below is the method to run the simulation. First, a for-loop is used to continually sum the acceleration caused by the force of the <code>j-th</code> mass onto the <code>i-th</code> mass over the distance that separates them (where <code>i =/= j</code>). From the net acceleration, velocity is obtained by multiplying the acceleration with the time-step; the position is calculated by multiplying the velocity with the time-step. This happens for each time-step in the outer loop; for each time-step, the newly calculated position, velocity, and acceleration are appended into their respective attributes of the class <code>CelestialBody</code>. </p>

<p>In the Eclipse Debugger -> Debug probe, there are only 3 options which are ST-Link(GDB), J-Link and ST-LINK(Open-OCD); i'm new to Eclipse and couldn't figure out if it could be possible somehow by modifying something with one of those options.</p>

<ul>
<li>Update:</li>
</ul>

<p>I have found a kind of a solution, to add an extension to include the IAR EW debugger inside eclipse:
<a href=""http://eclipse-update.iar.com/plugin-manager-install.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://eclipse-update.iar.com/plugin-manager-install.html</a></p>

<p>It is not a good solution as both IDEs need to be installed, and the project need to be created specifically for IAR to use its simulator, so it is not possible to create an STM32 project and use the IAR simulator for debugging.</p>

<p>Are there other solutions within eclipse, without using another IDE or an extesion?</p>
