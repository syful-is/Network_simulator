<p>the output is:</p>

<pre><code>At 0.0 value of state is: 0

<p>the output is:</p>

I imported the HUGE folder of source code using the ""Makefile Project with Existing Code"", and when I hit ""debug"" it runs the program. When I tell the debugger to stop, it often stops in a method I recognize, but when i click on the method's name, it says ""source not available"" even though the source file where the method is defined is actually open in another tab. I do have all the sources imported into the project. Am I missing something in the make configuration?</p>

<p>But here is what I need to do. </p>

<p>A line that starts with <code>+</code> is when a new packet is added to the network. 
A line starting with <code>r</code> is when a packet has been received by the destination. the double-typed number after the -t is the time at which that event happened. And finally, after the -i is the identity of the packet.</p>

<p>For me to calculate average end-to-end delay, I need to find every line that has a certain id after the -i. from there I need to calculate the timestamp of the <code>r</code> minus the timestamp of the <code>+</code> </p>

<p>So I figure there could be a regular expression separated by spaces. I could put each of the segements into their own variables. Then I would check the 15th (the packet ID). </p>

<p>But I'm not sure where to go from there, or how to put it all together. </p>

<p>I know there are some AWK scripts on the web for doing this, but they are all outdated and don't fit the current format (and I'm not sure how to change them). </p>

</code></pre>

<p>The ideal output of the script would recognize 2.134 as the start time, and 2.28 as the end, and then give me the delay of 0.146sec. It would do this for all packet IDs and only report the average. </p>

<p>It was requested that I expand a bit on how the file works, and what I am expecting.</p>

<p>The file is listing descriptions of about 10,000 packets. Each packet can be in a different state. The important states are <code>+</code> which means a packet has been enqueued at a router, and <code>r</code> which means the packet has been received by its destination. </p>

<p>It is possible that a packet that is enqueued (so a <code>+</code> entry) is not actually received and is instead dropped. This means we cannot assume that for every <code>+</code> entry there will be a <code>r</code> entry.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to measure is the average end to end delay. What this means, is that if you look at a single packet, it will have a time it was enqueued, and a time it was received. I need to make this calculation to find its end-to-end delay. But I also need to do it for 9,999 other packets to get an average.</p>

<p>I've thought about it more, and heres generally how I think the algorithm needs to work. </p>

<ul>
<li>remove all lines that don't begin with a <code>+</code> or an <code>r</code> because they are unimportant.</li>
<li>go through all of the packet IDs (that is the numbers after -i, such as 1052 in the example), and put them into some sort of groups (multiple arrays perhaps). </li>
<li>each group should now contain all of the information about a particular packet. </li>
<li>inside the group, check if there is a +, ideally we want the very first +. Record its time. </li>
<li>look for any more <code>+</code> lines. Look at their time. It's possible the log is slightly jumbled. So its possible there is a <code>+</code> line later on that is actually earlier in the simulation.</li>
<li>If this new <code>+</code> line has an earlier time, then update the time variable with that.</li>
<li>assuming there are no more <code>+</code> lines, look for an <code>r</code> line. </li>
<li>if there is no <code>r</code> line, the packet was dropped so don't worry about it.</li>
<li>for every <code>r</code> line you find, all we need to do is find the one who has the lastest timestamp</li>
<li>The <code>r</code> line with the latest timestamp is where the packet was finally received.</li>
<li>subtract the <code>+</code> time from the <code>r</code> time, this gives us the time it took for the packet to travel. </li>
<li>Add this value to an array so that later it can be averaged.</li>
<li>repeat this process on every packet ID group, and then finally average the created array of delays. </li>
</ul>

<p>Thats a lot of typing, but I think its as clear as I can be in what I want. I wish i was a regex master, but I just don't have time to learn it well enough to pull this off. </p>

<p>Thanks for all your help, and let me know if you have any questions. </p>

<p>I'm quite new to ns-2, well by that I mean I can create simulations fine as long as I don't need to do anything outside of the core functionality.</p>

<p>I want to make a very simple SNMP model (as there is no SNMP model that I can find for ns-2), that is literally a case of 1 node polling all other nodes on a subnet, and the other nodes responding. This will happen every n seconds according to the polling rate.</p>

<p>It's easy enough to set up a CBR UDP agent with an interval parameter to model the polling, but what is the best way to get the other nodes to respond upon receiving a packet? Or is this even the best way to do it?</p>

<p>I ask this not in the spirit of expecting someone to plaster a massive C++ script here to help me, but because from what I can find by googling, it's hinted that this sort of thing should be quite straightforward using the Tcl interface.</p>

<p>Does anyone have the faintest idea what I'm on about and if so any useful pointers?</p>

0,0.3047,"packet, message, send, node, receive, application, multiple, datum, specific, server",0,2,"<p>I'm trying to adjust TCP to work well over real-time communication. To do this one of the specification is to force TCP to accept new data written by the application even when the buffer is full which makes TCP sometimes 'unreliable'. This way the applications write calls are never blocked and the timing of the sender application is not broken.
I think there must be an option in NS2 to make it possible.
So, How can I force TCP to discard the oldest data segment in the buffer and accept the new data written by the application in NS2?</p>

2,0.2205,"node, network, create, wireless, simulator, simulate, omnet, model, connect, sensor",0,0,"<p>Here is a paper named ""<a href=""http://gregorio.stanford.edu/sliang/rtm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">TCP-RTM: Using TCP for Real Time Multimedia Applications</a>"" by <a href=""http://gregorio.stanford.edu/sliang/"" rel=""nofollow"">Sam Liang</a>, <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/profile/david-cheriton/"" rel=""nofollow"">David Cheriton</a>.</p>

<p>This paper is to adapt tcp to be used in Real time application. 
The two major modification which i actually want you to help me are:</p>

<ol>
<li>On application-level read on the TCP connection, if there is no in sequence data queued to read but one or more out-of-order packets are queued for the connection, the first contiguous range of out-of-order packets is moved from the out-of-order queue to the receive queue, the receive pointer is advanced beyond these packets, and the resulting data delivered to the application. On reception of an out-of-order packet with a sequence number logically greater than the current receive pointer (rcv next ptr) and with a reader waiting on the connection, the packet data is delivered to the waiting receiver, the receive pointer is advanced past this data and this new receive pointer is
returned in the next acknowledgment segment.</li>
<li>In the case that the sender’s send-buffer is full due to large amount of backlogged data, TCP-RTM discards the oldest data segment in the buffer and accepts the new data written by the application. TCP-RTM also advances its send-window past the discarded data segment. This way, the application write calls are never blocked and the timing of the sender application is not broken.</li>
</ol>

<p>They actually changed the 'tcpreno with sack' version of tcp in an old linux 2.2 kernel in real environment.
But, I want to simulate this in <a href=""http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/"" rel=""nofollow"">NS2</a>.
I can work with NS2 e.g., analyzing, making performance graphs etc. I looked all the related files but can't find where to change.
So, would you please help me to do this.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what can I do? or give me a direction?</p>

<p>ps. I wrote the loop inside my TCL file but failed. My code was like:</p>

    set ns [new Simulator]
    .... 
    ....(my NS code)

<p>PS2. Hi guys, I am sorry for not expressing myself clear. I did follow the TCL syntax. My real code is the following:</p>

<pre><code>for {set i 1} {$i &lt; 100} {incr i} {
    set ns [new Simulator]

    ...
    ...

<p>And I solved this problem by rearranging my code to the following:</p>

<pre><code>set ns [new Simulator]
for {set i 1} {$i &lt; 100} {incr i} {
    ...
    ...
    ...
}
$ns run

<p>Now it runs 99 times. I don't know why, though :P</p>

<p>I need to connect virtual machine 1 to virtual machine 2 through ns3 network simulator.

Tap bridges were created on other virtual machine called simulator. 
Now, I need to connect these taps to network adapters (eth0) of virtual machines. Thus, I can reach virtual machine 2 from virtual machine 1. </p>

<p>Simulator also have 2 network adapters eth1 and eth 2 that may use to connect to virtual machines.</p>

<p>How can i connect them?</p>

<p>line 21 is the last line of the shell script (done)</p>

<p>The strange thing is If i run the same setdest command on the terminal, there is no problem! like 
$setdest -n 70 -p 10 -s 5 -t 900 -x 1000 -y 1000 -l 1 -m 50</p>

<p>I have made out where the problem is exactly. Its with the argument -l. If i remove the argument in the shell script, there is no problem. Now i will walk you through the modified setdest.cc where this argument is coming from.</p>

<p>This modified setdest file uses a text file initpos to read XY coordinates of static nodes for a wireless mesh topology. the relevant lines of code are</p>

<pre><code>FILE *fp_loc;
int locinit;

fp_loc = fopen(""initpos"",""r"");

while ((ch = getopt(argc, argv, ""r:m:l:n:p:s:t:x:y:i:o"")) != EOF) {       

switch (ch) {
case 'l': 
    locinit = atoi(optarg);

    usage(argv);
    exit(1);

        position.X = uniform() * MAXX;
        position.Y = uniform() * MAXY;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>What i dont get is...
In Shell script..
   -option -l if supplied by 0 returns no error, 
   -but if supplied by any other value (i used 1 mostly) returns this segmentation fault. 
In Terminal..
   -no segmentation fault with any value. 0 or 1 </p>

<p>something to do with the shell script surely. I am amazed what is going wrong where!</p>

So I want to create a simulation of a data center using ns2 where I will compare different protocols in 2 metrics.</p>

<p>I am reading the tutorial for ns2 and found some extra material on the Internet and I found some papers to also read that might give me an insight on how to go about simulations (though from a first overview I don't think so) but I would like to know if anyone can direct me towards with more solid examples with some explanations if possible in more complex networks (prefereably data centers)</p>

<p>The ns2 tutorial only covers the basics. I know that I will have to decide before hand what topology to use for my data center (I am currently between a typical 3 layer data center topology and BCube, mainly because I am curious about a certain topology benefiting a specific protocol but not making a difference in another). Based on that I will have to build it in the tcl files. Then I know that somehow I will have to feed it a workload which I assume is a schedule of action simulating traffic but I am not clear on how this is done. In the tutorial they only have the ""at"" cases which are pretty straightforward but don't see a way to help me in my case. I assume I will also have to maybe set the routing scheme but...</p>

<p>So this is what I have on my head so far. Clearly, I am little lost so any help would be appreciated. Papers with similar things, essays or descriptions of projects, tutorials...</p>

<p>I am using a loop to create them and set a label using the label attribute. My code is something like the following</p>

    set c($i) [$ns node]
    $c($i) color red
    $c($i) shape hexagon

$ns duplex-link $c(3) $c(2) 1Gb 10ms DropTail

<p>Any ideas what I am doing wrong? Incidentally would the line</p>

<pre><code>$c($i) label ""corei""
</code></pre>

<p>work if it was</p>

<pre><code>$c($i) label ""core$i""
</code></pre>

<p>it doesn't produce any errors but like I said no labels</p>

<p>Other than that I was trying to use a naming format like pod_layer_pos for my nodes and I read the post at <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16407983/tcl-cant-read-variable-no-such-variable"">Tcl can&#39;t read variable: no such variable</a> but I was wondering if when using arrays - associative - can I have more then one variable evaluated inside the parenthesis. For example can I have the following</p>

<pre><code>$ns duplex-link $core($i) $pod($j_$k) 1Mb 10ms DropTail
</code></pre>

<p>Is there in general a specific way to group sets of node in a naming convention. What I am thinking is a fat-tree topology so for k=4 we have 4 core switches 4 pod with 2 layers, each having 2 switches, and the lower layer connected to 2 servers/hosts. So I was thinking to have the core in an array and connect them using loops with all the rest nodes where the name would be like something </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pod[0-(k-1)]_layer[0-1]_switch[0-k/2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following seems to work but I want to make sure that it's not a fluke</p>

<pre><code>set p 0
set l 0
set s 0

set pod(0,0,0) [$ns node]
set pod(0,0,1) [$ns node]

for {set j 0} {$j &lt; 1} {incr j} {

Since i'm new to ns2 I would like to know whether it is possible to actually simulate it using this tool.
The things that I require for my project:</p>

<p>1.Layers of encryption and decryption:
    After the packet moves from one node to another it should be possible for that node to decrypt/encrypt the packet that arrives to find the address of the next node the packet is to be forwarded to.</p>

<p>2.A server node that controls all the other nodes in the network and also has routing tables and calculates paths for a transfer of data.</p>

<p>3.Whenever a new node is added to the network the node should be processed by the server node.</p>

<p>4.Have our own encryption/decryption code.</p>

<p>Would like to know if all this is possible using ns2.
If not any alternative approach is appreciated.

<p>Here is what I did:</p>

<p>1.I followed this<a href=""http://www.nsnam.org/docs/manual/html/new-modules.html"" rel=""nofollow"">guide</a> to add a new noc module using the createModule script.</p>

<p>2.I went on and copied my module files into the new created noc directory and made waf(the build system ns3 uses) aware of my new files through editing the wscript file.</p>

<p>3.It is my understanding that with all this set up(I probably wrong) that with this set up,running the waf commands to rebuild ns3 should rebuild ns3 with my new module.</p>

<p>To build I give the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>  ./waf clean

  ./waf configure --enable examples

  ./waf build
</code></pre>

<p>The system goes on and builds ns3 and when it gets to my noc module it throws errors about objects of a Scalar Class not being defined in the scope.This usually means that I haven't included the header files but I have tried to copy them with other module files and included them with statements like #include ""nstime.h"" .With this the problem persisted. I tried copying the header with the definition of my class in the /usr/include directory and inlcuded it with #include  and the problem is still there.</p>

<p>I realize this is a long post ,I am sorry but I would really appreciate it if somebody helped point out what I am missing.Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>is it true that the number of dropped packet  is greater than the generated one????
pls anyone can explain that???
if there is simulation wrong pls tell me .</p>

<p>another question what dropped packet exactly mean in NS2 ??? dose it contain the intermediate node dropped packet? </p>

<p>void AODV::rt_resolve(Packet *p)</p>

<p>This function is invoked in two situations. First, when a mobile node is to send a
data packet and second, when an intermediate mobile node receives a data packet
which it must forward toward its destination.
If the function is invoked by a (source) mobile node that wants to send data
packets to some destination node, there is a check to determine if the destination
is a fixed node and the route to the fixed node is invalid. If this is the case,
the (source) mobile node broadcasts a RREQ_I message to discover a gateway.
Otherwise, the mobile node acts as described in the AODV draft without any
modifications.
If the function is invoked by an intermediate node which has received a data
packet which must be forwarded, the packet is processed differently depending
on if the intermediate node is a mobile node or a gateway. If the intermediate
node is a mobile node and it has a default route, the data packet is destined for a
fixed node. Therefore, the intermediate mobile node updates its route entry for
the fixed node and forwards the packet toward the gateway. On the other hand,
if the intermediate node is a gateway, it has received a data packet from a fixed
node destined for a mobile node. Consequently, the gateway broadcasts a RREQ
message to discover a route to the destination.</p>

<p>void AODV::sendRequest(nsaddr_t dst, u_int8_t flag)</p>

<p>This function is invoked when a mobile node needs to find a route to a destination
node by broadcasting a RREQ. The RREQ is broadcasted according to the
expanding ring search algorithm described in Section 3.3.1. However, when a
RREQ has been broadcasted through the whole network, i.e. when a mobile node
has done a network-wide search without receiving any corresponding RREP, it
assumes that the destination node is a fixed node located on the Internet. First,
the mobile node updates its route entry for the fixed node. Then, it checks for
buffered packets destined for the fixed node. In case there are such packets, they
are forwarded toward the gateway.
This function is also invoked when a mobile node needs to find a route to a
gateway by broadcasting a RREQ_I. The RREQ_I is broadcasted in the same
way as a RREQ message. A mobile node needs to find a route to a gateway
when it detects a link break and the destination of the route is a fixed node.</p>

<p>void AODV::recvRequest(Packet *p)</p>

<p>This function is invoked when a mobile node receives a RREQ or a RREQ_I
message. The message is processed differently depending on if the node is a
mobile node or a gateway. If the node is a mobile node, the code runs without
any modifications, i.e. the node tries to unicast back a RREP to the originator of
the RREQ message. However, in case the node is a gateway, a RREP_I is unicast
back to the originator of the RREQ message.</p>

<p>void AODV::sendReply(nsaddr_t ipdst, u_int32_t hop_count, nsaddr_t rpdst,
u_int32_t rpseq, u_int32_t lifetime, double timestamp, u_int8_t flag)</p>

<p>This function is invoked by a node that has received a RREQ or a RREQ_I message
and either it is the destination or has a fresh route to the destination. The
function just unicasts back a RREP or RREP_I message (depending on the value
in the “flag” field) to the originator of the RREQ or RREQ_I. See comments
about function recvRequest.</p>

<p>void AODV::recvReply(Packet *p)</p>

<p>This function is invoked when a mobile node receives a RREP or a RREP_I
message. The message is processed differently depending on if it is a RREP or
a RREP_I. If the message is a RREP, the code runs without any modifications.
However, if the message is a RREP_I the mobile node saves the address of the
gateway and creates a (or updates the) default route with the address of the gateway
as the next hop. If the mobile node already has a route to another gateway
than the originator of the newly received RREP_I message, it performs gateway
selection with the number of hops to the gateways as metric.
Then the mobile node checks if it has any packets queued in its buffer destined
for a fixed node. If such packets exist and there exists a valid default route, all
packets queued in the buffer are forwarded toward the gateway.
If hybrid gateway discovery method is used, RREP_Is are broadcasted by the
gateway periodically. When a mobile node receives any of these RREP_Is it updates
its route entry for the gateway that originated the RREP_I and rebroadcasts
it so other mobile nodes can receive the gateway information. If a gateway receives
a RREP_I, it discards the message and does not rebroadcast it, to reduce
unnecessary network load.</p>

<p>rt_entry* AODV::find_send_entry(rt_entry *rt)</p>

<p>A function that searches the routing table and returns the correct route that a
packet should be sent to, i.e. it finds the correct next hop that the packets should
be forwarded to. This is needed since default routes, which are not valid next
hops, have been introduced. The routing table is searched for a correct next hop
only if the destination is a fixed node, otherwise (if the destination is a mobile
node) the function just return the next hop as indicated in the routing table.
As an example, take a look at Figure 4.3 in Section 4.5.3. If this function is
not invoked, the packets destined for FN will be sent to next hop “DEFAULT”
which is defined as -10 in aodv.h. Since there is no node with this address, the
packets will be dropped. Therefore, this function is invoked to find the correct
next hop, MN_A in this example. Hence, the packets are forwarded to MN_A
which forwards them to the gateway which forwards them toward FN.</p>

<p>The code is pretty short and neat, however due to the fact that I have little experience with C++ / OMNeT I could not understand what this line here does: <code>cMessage *copy = (cMessage *) msg-&gt;dup();</code> , more specifically the <code>(cMessage *)</code>. I know <code>msg-&gt;dup()</code> actually means <code>(*msg).dup()</code>. </p>

<p>Could anyone please elaborate, what actually happens in the memory?</p>

<p><strong>post Edit Addendum:</strong></p>

<p>code for <code>dup()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>virtual cMessage *dup() const 
{
return new cMessage(*this);
}
</code></pre>

<p>description for <code>dup()</code>: <em>Creates and returns an exact copy of this object.</em> 
Does this mean that <code>(cMessage *) msg-&gt;dup()</code> internally passes the address of object returned by <code>msg-&gt;dup()</code> to <code>*copy?</code></p>

<p><strong>The other confusing notation:</strong></p>

<pre><code>cMessage *Tic9::generateNewMessage()
{
    // Generate a message with a different name every time.

<p>I know that is related to many factors including the TwoRayInterferance model, in order to understand the underlying cause, i have several hypothesis :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The distance between the two nodes equal or exceed the transmission

<li>Collision of 2 packets, that are scheduled at the

are directly send if the channel is detected as idle, so if two
nodes decide to send air frames at the same time, collision can

<p>1- REQ message : what are the req_src and req_des in this message? is it change during flooding the request from source until it reach the destination? and what are the addresses for this header (( hdr_ip *ih = HDR_IP(p) ))
they change the ih->dadrr() AND the ih->saddr().
what is the relation between these addresses and the Request message addresses?</p>

<p>2- in the Request Message phase; the reverse table is built, so it contain for each entry &lt;&lt; destination, #hop, next hop , seq>>
So it built to be the destination = the original source, right?
on the other hand, could I consider this reverse entry as rout entry?</p>

<p>also on the Reply phase, when node receive (REP) message, it will lookup in its routing table for the key destination which is (( rp->rp_dst )) .
So the question here, is it the same of the reverse table? dose the (rp->rp_dst) represent the (( original destination)?</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>:</p>

<p>Though I have tried using the default constructor (which supposedly sets a propagation Loss model of <code>ns3::LogDistancePropagationLossModel</code>) There is no effect on the transmission bandwidth between nodes nor in the network jitter or lag when distance is changed. I then tried manually setting the propagation loss, which resulted in no connectivity when distance was set greater to 1.0. I am rather confused at this behavior. I feel that I am missing some value in my code that I should pass to ns-3 but cannot seem to find it. I have referenced example code but to no avail (<a href=""http://www.nsnam.org/doxygen/wifi-example-sim_8cc_source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsnam.org/doxygen/wifi-example-sim_8cc_source.html</a>). </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Just wanted to update on the situation. By disabling fragmentation and not trying to override the default propagation loss model, I was able to notice a change in connectivity over distance. For reference, the distances with noted connectivity drops are 27-30 Meters for Ofdm Rate 54Mbps and 55-60m for Ofdm Rate 24Mbps.</p>

<p>This still leads me to point out that when I attempted to ""override"" or add a propagation loss model onto the sim, I would lose connectivity beyond a distance of 1m. I tried overriding with Friis, the default Log Distance, and Kun2600 and all had the same effect. Working Code is below.</p>

So far I've developing the simulations and loading my current linux kernel with DCE, but now I intend to change my workflow.</p>

<p>For every script simulating traffic in a given topology I want to be able to load different linux kernels to the simulation, as TCP changes considerably from one version to the other.</p>

<p>For example, having a simple traffic exchange simulation named <strong>simulation.cc</strong>, and a set of kernel versions <strong>(3.0-3.8)</strong> for example, I'd like to run the simulation for each kernel in the easiest way possible:</p>

<p><strong>./simulation -> (with kernel 3.0)</strong> and measure whatever I want.</p>

<p><strong>./simulation -> (with kernel 3.1)</strong> and measure..</p>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>So far the only thing I can think of is to download to my computer all  different kernel versions, and then first run the simulation, reboot and change the kernel, and then do the simulation again, etc..</p>

What I'm looking for is a way to send said packet (received from an wireless interface) to another host which is directly connected over ethernet.</p>

<p>Let's say I receive a packet from wireless interface in host A, Host A has also an ethernet interface directly connected to host B, I want to forward that packet over the ethernet interface, so that host B receives this packet through it's ethernet interface.</p>

<p>I don't know what function to use in order to do that.</p>

<p>The project I'm working on is a big one, so I'll include code if specifically required as soon as it will be needed in order to answer my question.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>So, the final goal is to implement a wormhole attack in MANET networks.
In basic words, a wormhole attack involvs two attackers (ATTACKER_A and ATTACKER_B) that are directly connected to each other through an high speed conection, i.e. ethernet.
As soon as the neighborhood of ATTACKER_A sends a RREQ, and ATTACKER_A receivs it, it will forward the RREQ to ATTACKER_B through the ethernet instead of simply broadcasting it in the network.
When ATTACKER_B receives the RREQ, it will forward the RREQ over the air to it's neighborhood, acting as a normal node in a AODV manet network.</p>

<p>The result is that the neighborhood of ATTACKER_A is tricked to think that the hosts thar are near ATTACKER_B are part of it's own neighborhood, thus creating a wormhole between two distan part of the network.</p>

<p>Really, the theory is not that complicated.</p>

<p>I searched into all the aodv code in order to find the valuables functions I need to edit in order to implement that wormhole behaviour, and it turned out that I probably need to modify part of this function here</p>

<p>NA_AODV_rreq.cc</p>

<p>As you can see, the real problem is that all the code is inside the AODV source file, and cause of the high modularity I'm in trouble looking for the right way to implement that.
Also, the lack of documentiation is not helping at all.</p>

No matter my configuration in terms of IP addresses, routes etc. I cannot seem to make it work.<br>
I have seen many people struggling with it, but have not found any solutions posted anywhere. The readme file in the Emulation folder of INET is more confusing than helpful.
Hence, I would like your help in making the following simple network work and, hopefully, even make it (the post) a tutorial for others as well.</p>

<p>The network I want to build (could not be simpler):</p>

<pre><code>External Server &lt;----&gt; [ext0] ROUTER [ppp0] &lt;----&gt; [ppp0] Standard Host
</code></pre>

<p>My setup:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Software:</p>

<ul>
<li>OMNET++ 4.6 with PCAP enabled.<br></li>
<li>INET Integration head (includes several features that I like).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>OS:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Xubuntu in VirtualBox as a guest which hosts OMNET++. The reason for using Virtualbox is that my Host Win 7 machine refuses to run any external interface example with the error ""cSocketRTScheduler: couldn't set socketopt for raw socket."". I modified the source a bit and used WSAGetLastError function, which resolved the issue as ""The requested address is not valid in its context."".</p></li>
<li><p>Back to VirtualBox :)
Xubuntu has one network interface set to Host-only networking with IP address 10.0.0.1 and netmask 255.255.255.0 .</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Standard Host Setup in omnetpp.ini:</p>

<pre><code>**.server.numTcpApps = 1
**.server.tcpApp[*].typename = ""TCPSinkApp""
**.server.tcpApp[*].localAddress = ""172.0.1.111""
**.server.tcpApp[*].localPort = 10021
</code></pre>

<p>The standard host is using the same server.mrt from extServer example.</p>

<p>The router.mrt is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>ifconfig:
# interface 1 to server
name: ppp0
    inet_addr: 172.0.1.100
    Mask: 255.255.255.0
    MTU: 1500
    POINTTOPOINT MULTICAST

# interface 2 to external server (real network interface)
name: ext0
    inet_addr: 10.0.0.2
    Mask: 255.255.255.0
    MTU: 1500
    POINTTOPOINT MULTICAST
ifconfigend.

route:
#Destination     Gateway          Genmask          Flags  Metric  Iface
172.0.1.111      172.0.1.100      255.255.255.255  H      0       ppp0
10.0.0.1         10.0.0.2         255.255.255.255  H      0       ext0
0.0.0.0          *                0.0.0.0          G      0       ext0
routeend.
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas on how to make this network work are really welcome as, should it work, I want to expand it later. Also, I would greatly appreciate it if any suggestions are in step-by-step style.</p>

6,0.4673,"error, omnet, omnetpp, variable, installation, window, unable, read, problem, ubuntu",0,0,"<p>I am using NS2 to simulate a modified routing protocol. This is how it works in brief:</p>

<p>I create some nodes using a .tcl file. For every node, a routing agent is created by the following:</p>

<pre><code>static class WFRPclass : public TclClass {
public:
WFRPclass() : TclClass(""Agent/WFRP"") {}
TclObject* create(int argc, const char*const* argv) {
    assert(argc == 5);
    return (new WFRP((nsaddr_t) Address::instance().str2addr(argv[4])));
}
} class_rtProtoWFRP;
</code></pre>

<p>The new <code>WFRP(nsaddr_t)</code> is the constructor. This is the constructor code:</p>

<pre><code>WFRP::WFRP(nsaddr_t id) : Agent(PT_WFRP),bcnTimer(this), rtcTimer(this){

index = id;      
seqno = 0;
dest=0;
rand=371+(id*2);
nod++;


printf(""N (%.6f): Routing agent is initialized for node %d ,Random Number   is %d\n"", CURRENT_TIME, id,rand); 
LIST_INIT(&amp;rthead);
posx = 0;
posy = 0;   

logtarget = 0;
ifqueue = 0;

}
</code></pre>

<p>The above code runs in a .cc file.Lot of packet forwarding functions are defined here,and every node that forwards a packet increases it seq no by one.
The constructor and it's class are defined in a .h file</p>

<p>The class in .h are as follows</p>

<pre><code>class WFRP : public Agent {
friend class RouteCacheTimer;

public:
WFRP(nsaddr_t id);
.....
/lot of functions defined here
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can one constructor of the class say WFRP(5) [nsaddr_t are just simple int numbers,ranging from 0 to number of nodes I create.They are sequential]</p>

<p>Can WFRP(5) access WFRP(8)'s seqno? Both these constructors will increase the values seqno independently of each other, so can I?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> 
The code is used in NS2.It uses a combination of tcl(front end) and c++(back end).This statement in tcl</p>

<pre><code>$ns at 1.0 ""[$mnode_(0) set ragent_] sink""
</code></pre>

<p>shifts the control to this line of c++ code</p>

<pre><code>if(strncasecmp(argv[1], ""sink"", 4) == 0) {
        bcnTimer.handle((Event*) 0);
    printf(""N (%.6f): sink node is set to %d, start beaconing ,Random Number set to %d \n"", CURRENT_TIME, index,rand);          
        return TCL_OK;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Notice in the tcl line it is  [mnode_(0)]..so right now the control flow is in WFRP(0) i.e. nsaddr_t =0.
Can WFRP(0) access WFRP(5) variable values.</p>

<p>Apologies,if the question is unclear.</p>

Is it possible to make two different type of packets(containing different headers) in the same simulation
In my protocol there are two types of struct header { } . At few instances i want to use one and at other instances want to use another.One of the structure has very less fields compared to other so this would reduce the size of packet i'm sending.
Is it possible ? and if yes then how to implement that?</p>

<p>in order to debug the error, i used valgrind with this command :</p>

<pre><code>valgrind --tool=memecheck ./veins (with veins is the current binary of my simulation)
</code></pre>

<p>but it seems that all the returned error are not related to my code (because i do the same with a previous code that works fine and i get the same output)</p>

RUNTIME ERROR. A cRuntimeError exception is about to be thrown, and you requested (by setting debug-on-errors=true in the ini file) that errors abort execution and break into the debugger.

You should now probably be running the simulation under gdb or another debugger. The simulation kernel will now raise a SIGABRT signal which will get you into the debugger. If you are not running under a debugger, you can still use the core dump for post-mortem debugging. Once in the debugger, view the call stack (in gdb: ""bt"" command) to see the context of the runtime error.

&lt;!&gt; Error in module (cCompoundModule) scenario (id=1) during network setup: Class ""ObstacleControl"" not found -- perhaps its code was not linked in, or the class wasn't registered with Register_Class(), or in the case of modules and channels, with Define_Module()/Define_Channel().

TRAPPING on the exception above, due to a debug-on-errors=true configuration option. Is your debugger ready?

<p>It seems to work as I can type ""ns"" at the end and get the % symbol. The issue I seem to be getting is that it doesn't seem to recognize the name of my protocol from the TCL file. It gives me the error: </p>

<pre><code>    invalid command name ""Mac/pa3""
         while executing
    ""$val(mac) set repeatTx_ $val(repeatTimes)""

<p>Where line 45 is as follows: </p>

<pre><code>    $val(mac) set repeatTx_ $val(repeatTimes);
</code></pre>

<p>It seems like it doesn't recognize the name of my protocol. I've implemented the protocol in pa3.cc and pa3.h files respectively. When I type ./configure then ""make clean"", then ""make"" from the ns-2.34 directory, it compiles without errors and generates the pa3.o object file. </p>

<p>I thought my TCL file was broken at first but it turns out that if I change the name to 802_11, it works fine with my TCL file. I believe that the error mentioned on line 45 is flagged because it doesn't think I have a protocol called pa3 installed. </p>

<p>Please advise as I've been coming up with dead ends for the past few days. Has anyone used NS2 and can tell me the procedure to add your own protocol? I don't want help evaluating the protocol but it seems I need to make the TCL file somehow recognize my pa3 protocol. I've searched and searched but nothing I've tried has worked.</p>

7,0.423,"implement, find, add, function, route, code, class, type, program, call",0,0,"<p>Firstly, my apologies should this not be the correct forum for this question. I am trying to implement two tcp congestion control algorithms in OMNeT/INET for my thesis.</p>

<p>The first one is TCP-FIT, for which I have found pseudocode at <a href=""http://www.tcpengines.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tcp-whitepaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tcpengines.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tcp-whitepaper.pdf</a>.
The other one is TCP-Illinois, of which I have found a linux implementation at <a href=""http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/net/ipv4/tcp_illinois.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/net/ipv4/tcp_illinois.c</a>.</p>

<p>I cannot understand how to implement a few variables and methods in both mechanisms, and I would appreciate your help in figuring them out. A bit of help with the variable types would be welcome, as well.</p>

<p>In brief, for TCP-FIT:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>epoch_start</em> and <em>update_epoch</em> (I understand that epoch can be synonymous with RTT)</li>
<li><em>alpha</em> (value)</li>
<li><em>n</em> - what is it?</li>
<li>Is the RTT_cnt calculation correct ( under receivedDataAck() )?</li>
<li>Is the tcpFitUpdateN() function correct?</li>
<li>Have I implemented the pseudocode right?</li>
</ul>

<p>For TCP-Illinois:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>snd_cwnd_cnt</em> -- I think this is just a counter of how many packets have been ACKED.</li>
<li><em>snd_cwnd_clamp</em> -- Top limit of congestion window, I think I have it right.</li>
<li><em>end_seq</em> -- it seems to be needed, but I do not understand the ""ack"" parameter in <em>if (after(ack, ca->end_seq)) {...}</em>, which comes from the function <em>tcp_illinois_cong_avoid(struct sock *sk, u32 ack, u32 acked) {...}</em></li>
<li><em>tp->snd_nxt</em> -- is it equivalent to OMNeT++ state->snd_nxt?</li>
<li><em>sum_rtt</em> and <em>max_rtt</em> -- Do I calculate these values right?</li>
</ul>

<p>To my understanding, after reading the paper provided in the linux implementation, TCP-Illinois is functioning in the same manner as TCP-NewReno except the AIMD part. I bet this means I can keep most of the code of TCP-NewReno intact, except the TCP-SACK part and AIMD.</p>

<p>I would also appreciate any hints on the implementation and, of course, any comments on the correctness of the code. My current and almost complete implementation can be found on github, at <a href=""https://github.com/SpyrosMArtel/TCP-Fit-Illinois"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SpyrosMArtel/TCP-Fit-Illinois</a>.</p>

<p>I tried to set the modes with other standard values such as 0 or 31, but
every time I get SUMO crashed.
I am unable to figure out where else I should place this command. I tried
to set the mode in some other initialization stage by adding an <strong>else</strong> clause
to it but it crashes still. What's more, eve nthe the debugger on, no error
is being shown, either in the OMNeT++ window or the <code>sumolaunchd.py</code> output
in OMNeT++ cmd.
Please help to understand my error. Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> adding Error message info</p>

<p>To make things clear, I am not receiving any error message but the exit code. I searched for the code but got no help. The usual 'this app is not responding' window pops up and the sim ends, so I suspect SUMO to crash.</p>

<p>The OMNeT++ environment shows the following message:</p>

<p>I guess the NED files are loaded, but the classes in c++ files cannot be found, though I used <em>Define_Module</em>. Cloud is just a compound module, without any own c++ implementations, it creates no problems.

Inside, we have found the following scenario which is very useful to us:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mCpGp.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>where we have a lispMobileNode multihomed with two wlan interfaces which receives UDP packets (in particular VoIP or video) from a correspondent node which is not mobile called standardHost. This scenario works perfectly as expected and the routers correctly implement the LISP protocol. Now, our teacher asked us to extend this scenario: in particular we should collect data with two handover/handoff among three different LISP networks and so have added the needed modules and the scenario has become like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Do5o.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>The problem is that even if <strong>the lispMobileNode correctly connects to wirelessRouter 3 and gets a relative correct IP address after stopping receiving from wirelessRouter2</strong>, however this information is not forwarded to the LISP routers networks below and thus the UDP packets coming from the standardHost keep on being routed to wirelessRouter2. I am sure that there must be a problem with the .irt routing files we have written for each new component and so I am wondering if you can help me dealing with them because in my previous Omnet++ experiences I didn't need to manage with .irt files and so I am not an expert.

<p>There are many of this message concerning 192.168.0.7 and at a certain point it gives up. In other words the PITR2 does not forward the MapRequest from lispRouter4 to MapServer and to the central router; instead, the PITR2 sends MapRequest back to lispRouter4.
So there's something about that ppp0 on lispRouter4?</p>

<p>I do not understand why this occurs because in the system I have another couple of lisp routers and they work perfectly as expected. So there must be an error in the <code>.irt</code> files I think. I have written the <code>.irt</code> files in a specular way compared to the working routers, changing only the IP address. I don't know what it means that <em>""interface ppp0 is not broadcast""</em>... Here are the files of the added routers:</p>

<p>So far, if I start my simulation and it gets to the point where a node with an application starts that is waiting for input (in an endless loop), the whole thing blocks, it doesn't start other applications, it never even stops the simulation.

<p>The only difference between these two projects, is that <em>CB_CSW_Cloud</em> uses <strong>sqlite3</strong> library. I added it to the project with following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>set <strong>Project->Properties->OMNET++->Makemake->Options->Link->Additional Libraries to link with (-l option)</strong>: <em>sqlite3</em></li>
<li>set <strong>Project->Properties->C/C++General->Paths And Symbols->Library Paths</strong>: <em>C:/sqlite</em> </li>
</ol>

<p>Since I don't receive some exact information, why <em>libCB_CSW_Cloud</em> was not loaded, I don't know what causes the problem. I use it in exactly the same way, as other project <em>CB_CSW_Vehicle</em>, that works. This leads me to the suggestion, that the <strong>sqlite3</strong> library causes the problem. Is it possible? Can a project <em>CSW</em> have a reference to the other project <em>CB_CSW_Cloud</em>, that itself uses a library <em>sqlite3</em>? Or shall I also add this library to <em>CSW</em>? </p>

<p>Can you help me to run the <em>CSW</em> project? </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I solved my problem with adding sqlite3 library to the run configuration and copying the source code of the <em>CB_CSW_Cloud</em> and <em>CB_CSW_Vehicle</em> projects to the <em>CSW</em> project. It is really difficult in OMNET++ to have a lot of projects.</p>

<p>My start point is the default TraCI scenary demo, but here the vehicles send and receive, while the RSU just send in broadcast. I managed to fix manually my RSU (adding a <code>MapName.add.xml</code> file and import it from <code>MapName.sumo.cfg</code>, and later modifying <code>RSU.ned</code> and <code>omnetpp.ini</code>). So, at this point I can see my RSU on the simulation map, and the SUMO simulation end well. But for resolve my problem I need to allow RSU not only to send, but also to receive (I have to establish a V2I2V communication).</p>

<p>The copious material I found is sometimes similar to my goal, but dispersive and lacking, and none found any solution. How to edit this default scenery to reach this outcome? Would be extraordinary to have a complete and working code, or be driven by someone more experienced than me.</p>

<p>In this case sometimes I have the situation, that there are no vehicles on the road: the old vehicles leaved the road and the new one didn't appear yet. My console output looks like this:</p>

<p>It shows every vehicle, that started the journey, and the moment, when it ended its journey. So you can see, that all vehicles departed at time <em>1113 seconds</em>. Next vehicle will appear at time <em>1200 seconds</em>.</p>

<p>In this case OMNET++ ignores, that in some minutes a new vehicle will appear and goes fast through the simulation till the end, because it has no more events. I receive the message:</p>

<p><code>Simulation time limit reached -- simulation stopped at event #15076, t=86400.</code></p>

<p>How can I let OMNET++ know, that a new vehicle will appear in some minutes? Now only SUMO has this information in its route file. Here I have 6 flows. Every flow sends a vehicle every 30 minutes. In summary every 5 minutes a new vehicle appears at the beginning of the road.</p>

<p><code>&lt;flow id=""flow0"" type=""vtype6"" route=""B470"" begin=""0""  end=""1209600"" period=""1800""/&gt;

<p>As I understand, OMNET++ doesn't know anything about the future vehicles. How can I keep the simulation alive, until the next vehicle appear?</p>

<p>the first if works where strcmp is ""C"". but the second if does not. I actually want node B to send two messages to node A and C afterwards i want to send messages from c to A and c to B. Basically at initialize A send two messages, one to B and one to C. Now i want to send message from B to A and B to C
similarly from C to A and C to B how do i do that?</p>

<p>Moreover the second question is that how can i send message from all the nodes at the same time to the neighbor nodes i-e A sending message to B,C ; B sending message to A,c ; C sending to A,B. All, A B C sending messages at the same time?

<p>Since the sender's counter counts down to zero first than the receiver, the simulation run well but it does not record statistics since all that is done at the receiver.</p>

<p>after the counter is decreased to zero both the modules invoke a <code>finish()</code> function.</p>

<p>receiver's finish function:</p>

<p>After the simulation runs, the sender's <code>finish()</code> is invoked first and the simulation stops and no data is recorded in <code>/results</code> folder only blank <code>.vec</code> or <code>.sca</code> files exist. </p>

<p>also the terminal says <code>simulation fault: core dumped</code></p>

<p>The problem is how can I ""pause"" the sender block once the counter is run out and let the receiver invoke it's <code>finish()</code> function so that I could see the stats and also record all the data I need?</p>

I'm using Omnet++ 4.2.2, but probably the version doesn't matter.</p>

<p>I've read the Parallel Distributed Simulation chapter of the Omnet++ manual
and the principle seems very straightforward: 
simply assign different modules/submodules to different partitions. 
Following the provided cqn example</p>

<pre><code>*.tandemQueue[0]**.partition-id = 0
*.tandemQueue[1]**.partition-id = 1
*.tandemQueue[2]**.partition-id = 2
</code></pre>

<p>If I try to simulate relatively simple models everything works fine I can partition the model at wish.
However, when I start to run simulation that use Standardhost module, or modules that are interconnected using ethernet links that doesn't work anymore. </p>

<p>If i take for example the Inet provided example WiredNetWithDHCP (inet/examples/dhcp/eth), as experiment, lets say I want to run hosts in a different partition than the switch
I therefore assign the switch to a partition and everything else to another:</p>

<pre><code>**.switch**.partition-id = 1
**.partition-id = 0
</code></pre>

<p>The different partitions are separated by links, there is delay, and therefore it should be possible to partition this way.
When I run the model, using the graphic interface, I can see that the model is correctly partitioned however the connections are somehow wrong and i get the following error message:</p>

<pre><code>during network initialization: the input/output datarates differ
</code></pre>

<p>clearly datarates don't differ (and running the model sequentially works perfectly), by checking the error message this exception is triggered also by link not connected. This is indeed what happen. It seems that the gates are not correctly linked. </p>

<p>Clearly I'm missing something in the Link connection mechanism, should I partition somewhere else?</p>

<p>Due to the simplicity of the paradigm I feel like being an idiot but I'm not able to solve this issue by myself</p>

2. $ns simplex-link $eNB $UE($i) 10Mb 2ms LTEQueue/DLAirQueue

<p>If 1 is used, then [drop_->recv(p);] works; packets are dropped as usual also showing in trace file.
But, if 2 is used, then [Packet::free(p);] works; No drops as well as in trace file.</p>

<p>Can anyone help in this issue those who are using LTE model in NS 2.35?</p>

<p>In a normal case the vehicles shall appear in SUMO, according to the flows defined. The problem is that in my simulation vehicles appear spontaneously beginning with second <em>1014</em>.
I get the id of vehicles with <code>nodeId = mobility-&gt;getExternalId();</code>. Normally id is looking like <code>flow13.4</code>. When not planned vehicles occur their id is looking like <code>vtype0_1</code>. So SUMO just chooses some <em>vType</em> from my definitions and starts it. In this way about 1000 new vehicles are added to my simulation. Why is this happening? Does anybody know, in what cases SUMO starts a vehicle, apart from defining a flow?

There you can read that the <code>Variable   View ID     Type of the value   New Value</code> for this command are <code>0xa6 ""View #0"" string &lt;vehicle id&gt;</code>.<br>
 So I wrote a new function in <code>TraCICommandInterface.cc</code> to track a vehicle.</p>

    ASSERT(buf.eof());

<p>I used some constants from <code>TraCIConstants.h</code></p>

<pre><code>// track vehicle
#define VAR_TRACK_VEHICLE 0xa6
// command: set GUI variable
#define CMD_SET_GUI_VARIABLE 0xcc
// 8 bit ASCII string
#define TYPE_STRING 0x0C

<p>The function is called from <code>TraCIMobility.h</code>, which fills the node id with <code>getExternalID()</code>. </p>

Apparently, OMNeT++ complains because the module TAdhocHost, whose name is ""coche"",

I tried to track a vehicle using RSU when a vehicle continuously send a beacon(WSM) contained Vx(velocity to x-axis),Vy(velocity to y-axis),position,speed in <strong>every second</strong>.I used open-street-map for this scenario. After recorded beacon message(WSM) trough RSU,I found followings:</p>

<p>t0=0.839078378444 id=0 x0=299.711 Vx0=-0.0273485 y0=542.695 Vy0=-1.58621 AngleRed0=1.58804 Speed=1.58645<br>

<p>I used following code to set the properties in WSM in vehicle node which has been retrieved from RSU's onBeacon method:<br>
    wsm->setSpeed(traci->getSpeed());<br>
    wsm->setAngleRad(traci->getAngleRad());<br>
    wsm->setvecX(traci->getCurrentSpeed().x);<br>
    wsm->setvecY(traci->getCurrentSpeed().y);<br>
    wsm->setSenderPos(traci->getCurrentPosition());<br>
    wsm->setCarId(getParentModule()->getIndex()); </p>

<p>Now Calculation to check Vx and Vy are consistent:<br>
At time t1 = 1.839078378444,(x1,y1) = (299.711,542.695),(x2,y2)=(299.665,540.03)<br>
d=√(-0.046)²+(-2.665)² =  2.665396 So,1.588 = 91.032ᶿ, Cos(91.032)= -0.018008156, Speed=2.665396/1,Vx=Speed*Cosᶿ,Vx = 2.665396*Cos91.032=2.665396*(-0.018008156)= -0.0479 <strong>is not consistent</strong> with Vx0(-0.0273485)<br>
Vy= 2.66496 <strong>is not consistent</strong> with Vy0(-1.58621) and same for the others records. Therefor, d/t=speed=2.665396 <strong>is not consistent</strong> with speed=3.5225. Any advise or solution or clarify the concept?    </p>

6,0.3044,"error, omnet, omnetpp, variable, installation, window, unable, read, problem, ubuntu",0,0,"<p>I am working on Veins framework, inside OMNET++. I am developing a kind of controlled flooding in a vehicular network. I am trying to make the vehicles send the data only after 6 seconds (this value may be changed), so I created a schedule at the initialization of each vehicle (on TraCIDemo11p.cc), like this:</p>

<pre><code>if(sendData){ scheduleAt(simTime()+par(""dataInterval"").doubleValue(),sendDataEvt);}
</code></pre>

<p>On the TraCIDemo11p.h I created a map to be my buffer:</p>

<pre><code>//Creating a map to represent the vehicle's message buffer
typedef map&lt;string, WaveShortMessage*&gt; MyMapContextMessageBuffer;
typedef pair&lt;string, WaveShortMessage*&gt; MyPairContextMessageBuffer;
MyMapContextMessageBuffer contextLocalMessageBuffer;
</code></pre>

<p>So on the TraCIDemo11p.cc onData(WaveShortMessage* wsm) function I make a copy of the received message, update the number of received messages, add the message in the vehicle buffer and print the content of the buffer just to test if I inserted it correctly:</p>

<pre><code>//duplicating the message, so this vehicle has his own copy of the message
WaveShortMessage* wsmdup = wsm-&gt;dup();

//number of received messages
receivedMsgs++;

//add the msg in the  vehicle buffer, the GlobalMessageIdentification is the id of the message
contextLocalMessageBuffer.insert(MyPairContextMessageBuffer(wsmdup-&gt;getGlobalMessageIdentificaton(),wsmdup));

//accessing something in the -&gt;second on the buffer, it works in this function
cout&lt;&lt;""Sender ""&lt;&lt; contextLocalMessageBuffer.begin()-&gt;second-&gt;getSender()&lt;&lt;endl;
</code></pre>

<p>Then at the scheduled time the SEND_DATA_EVT (handleSelfMsg) is called to send the data, but I am getting an error when i try to access the contextLocalMessageBuffer.begin()-second (or it->second).</p>

<pre><code>//handleSelfMsg(cMessage* msg)
case SEND_DATA_EVT 

//if the vehicle has received a msg before
if(receivedMsgs != 0){
  //and the buffer isn't empty, the function is able to verify if the buffer isnt empty
  if(!contextLocalMessageBuffer.empty()){


    //if i try to access the begin-&gt;first it works    
    cout&lt;&lt;""GlobalMessageID ""&lt;&lt;contextLocalMessageBuffer.begin()-&gt;first&lt;&lt;"" "";
    //but if I try to access the begin-&gt;second-&gt;getSource(), it doesn't works in this function (i get an Error 139), but works inside of onData    
    cout&lt;&lt;findHost()-&gt;getFullName()&lt;&lt;"" messageID ""&lt;&lt;contextLocalMessageBuffer.begin()-&gt;first&lt;&lt;"" ""&lt;&lt;contextLocalMessageBuffer.begin()-&gt;second-&gt;getSource()&lt;&lt;endl;

    //if I remove those couts the iterator and the for works but the send doesn't (Error 139), because it is trying to access the it-&gt;second
    map&lt;string, WaveShortMessage*&gt;::iterator it;
    for(it = contextLocalMessageBuffer.begin(); it != contextLocalMessageBuffer.end(); it++){

      send(it-&gt;second)
    }    
  }
}
//create a new schedule to send data after a new interval
scheduleAt(simTime() + par(""dataInterval"").doubleValue(), sendDataEvt);
</code></pre>

<p>So, to summarize, my problem is that i am able to work with my map(contextLocalMessagebuffer) inside of the onData, but can't access it properly on HandleSelfMsg, both in the same code (TraCIDemo11p.cc). Obs: I tried to create a function that returns the value of the buffer, but the function wasn't able to access the buffer too.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

I am using two TCP modules built up in Inet: TCPBasicClientApp and TCPEchoApp.
The former works as a client and the former works as a server.</p>

<p>The number of cars (the module name is ""coche"") in the simulation is 100, and there are five concurrent transmissions:</p>

<pre><code>CLIENT    SERVER
Car 0 --&gt; Car 99
Car 1 --&gt; Car 98
Car 2 --&gt; Car 97
Car 3 --&gt; Car 96
Car 4 --&gt; Car 95
</code></pre>

<p>I am also using three routing protocols: AODV, DYMO and OLSR.
However, regardless of the configuration that I run, errors like this ocurr in the simulation:</p>

<pre><code>Error in module (TCPBasicClientApp) Highway.coche[*].tcpApp[0] (id = 35) at event #49519, t = 166: IPvXAddressResolver: module 'coche[98]' not found.
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, using AODV, the car 1 cannot communicate with the car 98. I learned that VACaMobil, after a time, deletes some cars while it is creating others beyond 100, 
such as  ""coche[110]"", ""coche[115]"", etc.</p>

<p>I don't understand why it keeps deleting and creating nodes; I thought that VACaMobil really generated a constant number of vehicles. </p>

<p>How can I fix this? Any help is appreciated.</p>

what I mean is RSU is not placed in a fix place but can be mobile as a node (car), based on the type car from sumo network.
for example, vehicle type bus as RSU and vehicle type car as mobile node.
So that all of vehicle-type-bus from sumo can be RSU-as-mobile-node

If it is difficult, could you give some simple example please? then I will try to understand how to use, which class can be used.</p>

Because the application relies on realistic traffic behavior, so I decided to use the <a href=""https://github.com/lcodeca/LuSTScenario"" rel=""nofollow"">LuST Scenario</a>, which seems to be the state of the art for such data. However, I'd like to use specific parts of this scenario instead of the entire scenario (e.g., a high and a low traffic load fragment, perhaps others). It'd be nice to keep the bidirectional functionality that VEINS offers, although I'm mostly interested in getting traffic data from SUMO into my simulation.</p>

<p>One obvious way to implement this would be to use a warm-up period. However, I'm wondering if there is a more efficient way -- simulating 8 hours of traffic just to get a several-minute fragment feels inefficient and may be problematic for simulations with sufficient repetitions.</p>

<p>Does VEINS have a built-in mechanism for warm-up periods, primarily one that avoids sending messages (which is by far the most time consuming part in the simulation), or does it have a way to wait for SUMO to advance, e.g., to a specific time stamp (which also avoids creating vehicle objects in OMNeT++ and thus all the initiation code)?</p>

<p>In case it's relevant -- I'm using the latest stable versions of OMNeT++ and SUMO (OMNeT++ 4.6 with SUMO 0.25.0) and my code base is based on VEINS 4a2 (with some changes, notably accepting the TraCI API version 10). </p>

Because these have a very long run time, I'm trying to use the university cluster servers (KITE 2.0/RHEL6.6/Lustre 2.5.29.ddnpf3) -- however, I've now encountered several different run time bugs, with the same code that runs perfectly fine on my local machine (Fedora 23). I'm looking for a way to easily debug this problem. I suspect that the cause lies somewhere in the different <code>gcc</code> version, or perhaps some other system level library that I can't change remotely (but I'm not sure). I'm certain that the OMNeT++ version is the same; the VEINS library is provided by me and is the same locally and remotely.</p>

<p>An example of the issues I've encountered is <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/omnetpp/OxRwN9w-VZM"" rel=""nofollow"">discussed here</a>, which I eventually fixed <a href=""https://github.com/namnatulco/veins/commit/219798d4a560d015ed460dc3aa7fc31332d0a826"" rel=""nofollow"">like this</a> (as far as I can tell, both versions have the same semantics... <code>DimensionSet</code> extends <code>std::set</code>, and <code>DimensionSet::timeFreqDomain</code> is a <code>static const</code> initialized with <code>(Dimension::time, Dimension::frequency)</code> as in the fix).</p>

<p>What is a good approach to look for the cause? Is there a simple way to ""cross-compile"" between these machines, or some way to diff the binaries to look for the cause? Where do I look for common ways to deal with problems like these?</p>

<p>(despite of the fact that environment variable ""PATH"" is set to omnet++ bin directory).</p>

<p>So, I checked <strong>omnet++</strong>'s bin folder and saw that for <strong>opp_msgc</strong> there was no <strong>.cmd</strong> file.</p>

<p>Please guide me for how to generate <strong>_m.h</strong> and <strong>_m.cc</strong>.
Earliest will be the best. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Outline of steps:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Add tcp-westwood.cc &amp; tcp-westwood.h files to tcp folder in
the main ns2 directory (ns-2.35)</li>
<li>Edit the makefile to include tcp-westwood.o file (within the obj_cc variable).</li>
<li>Add the appropriate lines to ns-default.tcl file (see link)</li>
<li>Recompile (recompile steps: go to ns-2.35 directory; type ""./configure""; type
""make"")</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong>
To try out TCP Westwood protocol (a third party protocol source code) in ns-2 to simulate some network scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
When I run test.tcl using the Reno tcp protocol I get no errors. But when I change the line ""set tcp [new Agent/TCP/Reno"" to  ""set tcp [new Agent/TCP/Westwood"" in the test.tcl file, I get the output from the screen shot (see attached).</p>

For one property of this channel type's instances, I'd like to assign a random parameter. However, the random number should be the same for connected gates.</p>

<p>My node definition has the following gates definition:</p>

<pre><code>simple GridAgent
{
    /* ... other paramters/definitions omitted ... */
    gates:
        inout agentConnections[];
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my network configuration, I connect nodes using the simple <code>&lt;--&gt;</code> syntax, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>someSwitchyard.agentConnections++ &lt;--&gt; AgentConnectionChannel &lt;--&gt; someWindfarm.agentConnections++;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this AgentConnectionChannel has a property called <em>impedance</em>, which I'd like to randomly assign. This <em>impedance</em> property should be the same for both A -> B and B -> A. I have tried to add <code>{ impedance = default(unitform(1, 10)) }</code> to the network definition, as well as putting <code>**.agentConnections$o[*].channel.impedance = uniform(1, 10)</code> into <code>omnetpp.ini</code>. In both cases, however, A -> B has a different value assigned than B -> A. </p>

<p>As indicated on the <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/omnetpp/hesVQSSCjjw"" rel=""nofollow"">OMNet++ mailing list</a>, this happens because the <code>&lt;--&gt;</code> syntax is actually a shorthand for creating two distinct connections, hence two drawings from the random number distribution happen.</p>

<p>How can I assign a random parameter to a connection's property <em>and</em> have the same value for both directions of two connected gates? Is there a way to do this in the <code>omnetpp.ini</code> file, or do I need to create a script in, e.g., Perl, Ruby, or Python to generate the <code>omnetpp.ini</code> for my runs?</p>

<p>But the problem is that I don't know other languages except for PHP or Java and I think it would take more time for me to try to understand Veins, rather than doing it in Java.</p>

<p>I have seen that, in the case of Java, there is a library called traci4j, which aims to be the substitute to TraCI in Java language.</p>

<p>I think, the first big step to accomplish would be to be able to run SUMO and OMNeT++ from Java. Once I achieve this, then I would proceed to work on the data exchange between both programs.</p>

<p>However, I was making some trials, all of them unsuccessful, to run SUMO-gui from my simple program:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {

    String configFile = ""test/resources/sumo_maps/Test2/Test2.sumo.cfg"";
    SumoTraciConnection trial = new SumoTraciConnection(configFile,-1);
    trial.runServer(true);

}
</code></pre>

<p>But I keep receive the following. I have tried to follow this with the debug mode but it was a really tedious work and in the end I couldn't get anything.</p>

<pre><code>ERROR StatusLogger No log4j2 configuration file found. Using default configuration: logging only errors to the console.

    at trial.TrialConnection.main(TrialConnection.java:32)
</code></pre>

<p>I would really appreciate if you could tell me what is scaping from my thoughts. Any other comment regarding my idea and way of planning my thesis would be also appreciated.</p>

<p>BTW, I am using SUMO 0.25, OMNeT++ 4.6 and Eclipse Mars.2 Release (4.5.2)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your attention</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>I manage to find the origin of the Exception, you can find it as an Answer. However, I keep receiving the error:</p>

<p>ERROR StatusLogger No log4j2 configuration file found. Using default configuration: logging only errors to the console.</p>

<p>Anyway, this doesn't seem to affect the running of the program, since I run it succesfully. However, if I don't press the Run button, it doesn't work!</p>

<p>I have been looking through the different methods contained in Traci4j but I haven't found anything. The only related-part-of-code that I have found is in the class Constants:</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Reverting back my code to use Qt4 solved the problem and I can run my application flawlessly. So I guess the error was due to mixing Qt4 and Qt5 libraries. Omnet++ is using Qt4 and my C++ code is using Qt5. Is there any way to use Qt5 library in OMNET 5?</p>

I used realistic map, when I running the project and get results , I could not know how to compute the probability, I try to take part of area (RoiRect) but it still I have the same issue, may be I need to compute the probability for specific range or should I take small area, to have accurate results?</p>

<p>For the included results, I stopped the simulation with 36 nodes.

<p>I want to build a basic converge-cast wireless network to test the network-coding in Omnet with INET. The basic structure of this network is shown in the Figure 1. There are two sources S1 and S1, two relay nodes C1 and C2, and one destination D. in this topology S1, C1 and C2 are within each other’s broadcast range, and S2, C1 and C2 are within each other’s broadcast range. In a certain time period, two groups of packets X = {x1, x2, …, X|x|} from S1 to D and Y = {y1, y2, …, Y|y|} from S2 to D are received by C1 and C2. So C1, C2 can encode X and Y together before forwarding them. </p>

<p>(1) <em>Overhearing</em>: Every node should work in a promiscuous mode. So the relay C2 and C1 can overhear packets transmitted from S1 and S2 to D respectively. </p>

<p>(2) <em>Encoding</em>: When relay C1 receives the native packets X and Y, it encodes these packets together and broadcasts the coded packet to receivers D. The same procedure will be done in C2. The encode operation is merely a simple random linear combination of native packets as Z1=ga1*X1+gb1*Y1, where the ga1 and gb1 are the coefficients randomly selected from a q-order Galois field GF(q). And Z1 is the coded packet. The coefficients will be included in the header of the coded packets.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Decoding:</em> D will decode all packets in X and Y using the received coded packets Z1 from C1 and C2 together.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Benefit</em>: For example, The packets x1 and x2 are to be joined up with each
other in D. However, the link from S2 to C2 (LS2→C2 ) fails. Evidently, in case of non-network-coding schemes, at least one retransmission is required to ensure the success of packet delivery. But it is different if the idea of network coding is employed. Since C1 can overhear x2, it would combine x1 and x2 by means of XOR or linear network coding [2] (in fact, XOR is a special kind of linear network coding scheme with GF(2)). Assume the coded packet is (x1 ⊕ x2). And likewise, C2 can overhear x1 and just only forward it to D for it only get one packet. Finally, D is able to recover x2 by reXOR the coded packet with x1, as shown in Fig.1(b). Hence, network coding in converge-cast is able to reduce the probability of retransmission. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I would like to use ieee802.11 standard of radio transmission which is usually used in wireless network. I hope this standard can control the link reliability or packet deliver ratio. </p></li>
<li><p>For simple, let S1 and S2 are synchronized. I'm not quite sure how long it should wait for packet from S2, can you give me an advice ?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, I want to multiply each 8 bits with ga1. How about mod the overflow    numbers. </p></li>
<li><p>I want to add the values. If the multiply and add operation is hard to achieve. We can simply the recover operation. For instance, as C1 and C2 will receive both x1 and x2 and they will choose coefficient to multiply them. When the sink node D receive the coded packet, We can put these four coefficients in a 2x2 matrix like [C11, C12; C21, C22] to check weather they are independent, if they are independent, we can assume that the packet x1 and x2 can be successfully decoded. </p></li>

<p>As for how to customize the network packet, I don't have any idea at all, and I am confuse where to start. But for creating custom nodes, I have read the tutorial book that all node are essentially derived from <code>Node</code> class (correct me if I'm wrong), so initially I imagined that I can just create my <code>CustomNode</code> class inheriting NS3's <code>Node</code> class like:</p>

<pre><code>class CustomNode : Node { ... }

<p>However, when I looked at the sample code, they provide many examples using <code>NodeContainer</code> helper used like:</p>

<pre><code>NodeContainer container;
container.Create (1);
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see in the code, there is only one argument in the function <code>create()</code> which is related to the total number of nodes to be created and no other argument nor template to specify the type of the Node. I wish I could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>container.Create&lt;CustomNode&gt;(1);

<p>To put everybody in context, I'm simulating 100 nodes (4 flows of 25 nodes), all under coverage (apparently), and sending 10 packets per second each. Depending on the moment the nodes enter the network (i.e: are created by SUMO), some of them (usually just 1 but can be 2, 3, 4...) enter in a mode where all packets are marked as lost (SNIRLostPackets) as they receive a packet while another packet is already being received (according to the Decider the NIC is already synced to another frame). </p>

<p>That doesn't suppose to happen in 802.11 unless there are hidden nodes  and the senders don't see each other at the moment of sending their respective frames (both see the the channel idle) right?</p>

<p>So, this behavior is not expected at all and destroys the final lost packets statistics. I tuned the transmission powers of transmission and interference range but nothing changes.</p>

<p>It happens too often to ignore it and I would like to know if anybody has experienced this behavior and how it was solved.</p>

3,0.36,"vein, omnet, vehicle, sumo, change, rsu, car, scenario, simulation, speed",0,1,"<p>In Veins/Omnet++ simulation, how can I determine when two vehicles are in range to exchange data? Suppose, I have three vehicles in a simulation (v1, v2, v3). During simulations these vehicles pass each other a few times. Now suppose v1 and v2 passes each other, each going in opposite directions. The encounter lasts about 5seconds( by encounter, I mean, that these two vehicles exchange data for 5 seconds, or that v1 receives data from v2 during these 5 seconds). My question is: how can I find out for how long has v1 and v2 been in contact each other? Keeping in mind that they might encounter each other several times over the course of simulations. So at the end I can have something like this generated for v1:</p>

<pre><code> 1-  &lt;tstart, tend, #packets exchanged&gt;
 2-  &lt;tstart, tend, #packets exchanged&gt;
 .

<p>where <code>tstart</code> would represent the time <code>v1</code> started exchanging packets with another vehicle(vx), and <code>tend</code> would represent end of data exchange with that vehicle (vx) and <code>#packets exchanged</code> would show how many packets was exchanged between <code>tstart</code> and <code>tend</code>.</p>

The problem I'm having is that I need to estimate at witch time a packet is going to arrive at it's destination.</p>

<p>So more specific: There are two EtherHost, named H0 and H1 (inet.node.ethernet.EtherHost) and one EtherSwitch named switch (inet.node.ethernet.EtherSwitch), the three are connected like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>H0 &lt;-> C &lt;-> switch &lt;-> C &lt;-> H1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>C denotes a DatarateChannel with datarate = 100Mbps and delay = 0.1us. When the EtherAppCli in H0 sends a EtherAppReq to H1, I need to get a ETA on the EterAppReq packet during the transfer of said packet.</p>

<p>My first thought was to always get the encapsulating package of EtherAppReq, wich is added in the EtherLLC and EtherMAC module but this is not as simple as I thought.. I would need to change all the encapsulating functions in all the lower layers to always get a pointer to the encapsulating package, or am I wrong?</p>

<p>Or is there another way to get a ETA of a packet mid-transfer?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> For my purpose I only need the arrival time at the next module, so if the packet is in the mac module of H0 I need the arrival time at the mac layer in the switch (So no multi module hops). Like when you have a cMessage you can call getArrivalTime() on the message and get a estimate of the arrival time if I'm not mistaken.</p>

<li>Say, you had a vector of inout gates, if you used getBaseId, to get the base id of the gates in the vector. if you iterated through the vector would the gate you get using each increment on the base id be an inout gate, or an input/output gate?</li>

7,0.2344,"implement, find, add, function, route, code, class, type, program, call",0,1,"<p>At aodv When the node receive route request it will check if it has valid route to the destination, if it has no valid route it will rebroadcast the route request. I want to add timer before the node rebroadcast the route request.During the timer time if the node receive RREQ with the same ID (that means the node receive the RREQ twice ) then discard the RREQ otherwise  rebroadcast the RREQ. I don’t know how to write the code of this part. 
The code of timer
1.  The timer was defined in aodv.h </p>

<pre><code>    class RouteRequestTimer : public Handler {
    public: 
    RouteRequestTimer(AODV* a) : agent(a) { busy_ = 0; }
    void handle(Event*);
    void start(double time);

    inline int busy(void) { return busy_; }
    private:
    AODV *agent;
    Event intr;
    int busy_;
    };
</code></pre>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>The timer was declared in the routing agent aodv.h</p>

<pre><code>friend class  RouteRequestTimer;
RouteRequestTimer rrtimer;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In aodv.cc, implement the handle function </p>

<pre><code>void RouteRequestTimer::handle(Event*) {
busy_ = 0;
#define interval 0.5
fprintf (stderr, ""This is a test for the usage of timer.\n"");
Scheduler::instance().schedule(this, &amp;intr, interval);
}
void RouteRequestTimer::start(double time) {
Scheduler &amp;s = Scheduler::instance();
assert(busy_ == 0);
busy_ = 1;
s.schedule(this, &amp;intr, time);
}
void RouteRequestTimer::stop(void) {
Scheduler &amp;s = Scheduler::instance();
assert(busy_);
s.cancel(&amp;intr);
busy_ = 0;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The timer was initialized at aodv.cc</p>

<pre><code>AODV::AODV(nsaddr_t id) : ..., rrtimer(this), ... {
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The timer was used at the function that receive the route request</p>

<pre><code>void
AODV::recvRequest(packet *p){
…
…
…
Scheduler::instance().schedule(&amp;rrtimer, p-&gt;copy(), inerval);  
…
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Then I recompile ns2 and the compilation completed with no error.
When I run the tcl code for the network using aodv, this error appear</p>

<p><strong>scheduler: Event UID not valid</strong></p>

<p>please how to solve this error and how to check the received  route request id on the timer, if a RREQ with the same id is received then discard the packet otherwise forward it.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>It is possible that this is not strictly about INet, but a general behavior of <a href=""https://omnetpp.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OmNet++</a>. Here's the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When sending a <code>cPacket</code>/<code>cMessage</code> and it is received by multiple stations/modules, is it copied or all receivers get a pointer to the same instance?</p>

<h3>Real scenario</h3>

<p>So, in such a network:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kvur4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kvur4.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Station <code>A</code> is sending a <code>cMessage</code> which is received by all the other stations. Of course only one station is the receiver, everyone else will drop the packet. So if <code>B</code> is the receiver and <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, <code>E</code> and <code>F</code> go:</p>

<pre><code>void handleMessage(cMessage *msg) {
  if (this-&gt;isNotForUs())
    delete msg;
}

<p>Will it cause <code>B</code> to have its frame destroyed?</p>

in this moment I am working on a trilateration method based on RSSI for
Cooperative Positioning (CP).
I am considering the Analogue Model : Simple Path Loss Model</p>

<p>But I have some doubts in how to calculate the distance correctly for a determined Phy Model.
I spent some time (one day) reading some papers of Dr. Sommer about the  PHY models included in veins. </p>

<p>Would anyone help-me with this solution?
I need a way to:</p>

<p>1) <em>Measure the power of an receiver when its receive a beacon (I found this in the Decider class).</em>
    In the Decider802.11p the received Power can be obtained with this line in method Decider80211p::processSignalEnd(AirFrame* msg):</p>

<pre><code>double recvPower_dBm = 10*log10(signal.getReceivingPower()-&gt;getValue(start));
</code></pre>

<p>2) <em>Apply a formula of RSSI accordingly the phy model in order to achieve a distance estimation between transmiter and receiver.</em></p>

<p>3) <em>Asssociate this measure (distance by RSSI) with the Wave Short Message to be delivered in AppLayer of the receiver (that is measuring the RSSI).</em></p>

<p>After read the paper <em>""On the Applicability of Two-Ray Path Loss Models for Vehicular Network Simulation""</em>
and the paper <em>""A Computationally Inexpensive Empirical Model of IEEE 802.11p Radio Shadowing in Urban Environments""</em>
and investigating how it works in the veins project. I noticed that each analogue model have your own path loss model
with your own variables to describe the model.</p>

<p>For example for the  SimplePathLossModel we have these
variables defined on AnalogueModels folder of veins modules:</p>

<p><em>lambda</em> = 0.051 m (wave length to IEEE 802.11p CCH center frequency of 5.890 GHz)</p>

<p>A constant <em>alpha</em>  = 2 (default value used)</p>

<p>a distance factor given by <code>pow(sqrDistance, -pathLossAlphaHalf) / (16.0 * M_PI * M_PI);</code></p>

<p>I found one formula for indoor environments in this <a href=""https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/83354/calculate-distance-from-rssi"">link</a>, but I am in doubt if it is applicable for vehicular environments.</p>

<p>Any clarification is welcome. Thanks a lot.</p>

<p><strong>[edit1]</strong> Based on the answer below I am adding here the reason behind why I am trying to force the condition to be true</p>

<p>The code below is always checking the first condition and executing else. It is in initialize so it doesnt depend on any previous executed class and the queueModule member is set in class definition as protected member</p>

<pre><code>class INET_API EtherMACBase : public MACBase

    queueModule = nullptr;

<p>I created some code, which gives me reliable results in ‘step-by-step’- or ‘animated’ simulation mode. The moment I change to ‘fast’ or ‘express’ mode, it gets buggy. The following simplified example will explain my problems:</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>    void MyMacSlave::handleSelfMessage(cMessage *msg)
{
    if (msg == CheckAck) {
         std::cout &lt;&lt; “CheckAck: “ &lt;&lt; msg &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    if (msg == transmissionAnnouncement) {
         std::cout &lt;&lt; “transmissionAnncouncement: “ &lt;&lt; msg &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    if (msg == transmissionEvent) {
         std::cout &lt;&lt; “transmissionEvent: “ &lt;&lt; msg &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    delete msg;
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is a function, which is called for handling self-messages. Depending on what self-message I got, I need to run different if queries.</p>

<p>I get this correct output in step-by-step or animated mode:</p>

<pre><code>CheckAck: (omnetpp::cMessage)CheckAck
transmissionAnncouncement: (omnetpp::cMessage)transmissionAnncouncement
transmissionEvent: (omnetpp::cMessage)transmissionEvent
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the strange output I get using fast or express mode:</p>

<pre><code>CheckAck: (omnetpp::cMessage)CheckAck
transmissionAnncouncement: (omnetpp::cMessage)transmissionAnncouncement
transmissionAnncouncement: (omnetpp::cMessage)transmissionEvent
transmissionEvent: (omnetpp::cMessage)transmissionEvent
</code></pre>

<p>The third output line shows that the self-message is ‘<strong>transmissionEvent</strong>’, but the <em>‘if (msg == transmissionAnnouncement)’</em> is mistakenly considered as true as well.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>As shown above I get different simulation results, depending on the simulation mode I am using. What is the reason for the different output? Why is there even a difference?</strong></p>

So far I have completed my grid and introduce mobile nodes in it as well.

Here is what I modify:</p>

<p>I created a method called <code>""sendTrace""</code>that is similar to the one in the example but with the wsm data changed:</p>

<pre><code>void TraCIDemo11p::sendTrace() {


        t_channel channel = dataOnSch ? type_SCH : type_CCH;
        WaveShortMessage* wsm = prepareWSM(""data"", dataLengthBits, channel, dataPriority, -1,2);

        sendWSM(wsm);
         EV &lt;&lt; ""Received message2 `"" &lt;&lt; wsm-&gt;getSenderModuleId() &lt;&lt; ""', sending it out again\n"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>in traCIDemo11p.h
<code>const std::string traceID =""trace"";</code></p>

<p>In <code>onData</code> I add a condition on received messages:</p>

<pre><code>void TraCIDemo11p::onData(WaveShortMessage* wsm) {

    if (wsm-&gt;getWsmData()== traceID.c_str()){
        infoWsm.push_back(wsm);
        EV &lt;&lt; ""Received message3 `"" &lt;&lt; wsm-&gt;getSenderModuleId() &lt;&lt; ""', sending it out again\n"";
    }
    else{

findHost()-&gt;getDisplayString().updateWith(""r=16,green"");
annotations-&gt;scheduleErase(1, annotations-&gt;drawLine(wsm-&gt;getSenderPos(), mobility-&gt;getPositionAt(simTime()), ""blue""));

if (mobility-&gt;getRoadId()[0] != ':') traciVehicle-&gt;changeRoute(wsm-&gt;getWsmData(), 9999);
if (!sentMessage) sendMessage(wsm-&gt;getWsmData());
EV &lt;&lt; ""Received message4`"" &lt;&lt; wsm-&gt;getSenderModuleId() &lt;&lt; ""', sending it out again\n"";
    }
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>At the initialization I send the first trace:</p>

<pre><code>void TraCIDemo11p::initialize(int stage) {
BaseWaveApplLayer::initialize(stage);
if (stage == 0) {
    ...
    lastTraceAt = simTime();
    sendTrace();

}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>And in <code>handleParkingUpdate</code>I control the sending of other traces:</p>

<pre><code>void TraCIDemo11p::handleParkingUpdate(cObject* obj) {
isParking = mobility-&gt;getParkingState();
if (sendWhileParking == false) {
    if (isParking == true) {
        (FindModule&lt;BaseConnectionManager*&gt;::findGlobalModule())-&gt;unregisterNic(this-&gt;getParentModule()-&gt;getSubmodule(""nic""));
    }
    else {
        Coord pos = mobility-&gt;getCurrentPosition();
        (FindModule&lt;BaseConnectionManager*&gt;::findGlobalModule())-&gt;registerNic(this-&gt;getParentModule()-&gt;getSubmodule(""nic""), (ChannelAccess*) this-&gt;getParentModule()-&gt;getSubmodule(""nic"")-&gt;getSubmodule(""phy80211p""), &amp;pos);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Then while running I had this error !! </p>

<p>I included the inet path as follows:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;inet/src/transport/udp/UDP.h&gt;

<p>and I call it as follows, by passing as input <strong>UDP_C_CONNECT message</strong>.:</p>

<pre><code>cMessage *UDP_C_CONNECT;
void Inet::UDP::processCommandFromApp(UDP_C_CONNECT);
</code></pre>

<p>But when I run the simulation, it crashes, returning this error:</p>

<pre><code>Errors occurred during the build.
Errors running builder 'OMNeT++ Makefile Builder' on project 'veins'.
java.lang.NullPointerException

<p>1) Is there the correct way to set up the required connection?</p>

<p>2) Why I'm getting this error as soon as I include the inet path?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I also tried another way to establish the connection:</p>

<pre><code>std::string host;
host = ""16777343"";
int port = 5144;
Veins::TraCIConnection* connection;
connection = TraCIConnection::connect(host.c_str(), port);

<p>but as soon as it load the plugin, then it's like it is waiting for something at time 0.0 without starting the generation of the nodes.

<p>The idea is that H1 sends messages to the other two but in a scheduled way, e.g. H1 sends a message to P1 and wait for P1 to echo back, only upon reception of the echo from P1, it can send the message to P2.</p>

<p>My question is: how can I obtain this behavior? I am able to send a message to P1 and P2 but I don't know how to tell H1 to wait for the P1 reply before transmitting to P2.</p>

<p>Also another question about ARP. I am now using arpType = GlobalARP but I was wondering, how can I avoid that H1 sends ARP requests? How can I already tell H1 where to find certain hosts?</p>

<p>Since the network layer is not really necessary, is it possible to ignore it and use it just to forward the messages from the application layer to the MAC, which is then in charge to find the right destination address?</p>

<p>In this message type, I want to include a vehicle structure, as it follows:</p>

<pre><code>struct vehicle{
   int vehicle_id;
   Coord vehicle_pos;

<p>In the veins example there is a function called: <code>prepareWSM</code> that's declared in <code>BaseWaveApplLayer.h</code>. This function is a <code>virtual WaveShortMessage*</code> type. </p>

<p>If the  <code>wsm_info</code> was inherented from <code>WaveShortMessage</code> I wouldn't need to write and declare a new <code>prepareWSM</code> for <code>wsm_info</code>, right? </p>

<p>So how can I make this <code>wsm_info</code> message inherented of <code>WaveShortMessage</code>?</p>

<p>I tried to write like this in the <code>wsm_info.h</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class wsm_info : public WaveShortMessage
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of, that was written previously:</p>

<pre><code>class wsm_info : public ::omnetpp::cPacket

<p>But the error that I get is the following one:</p>

<pre><code>cannot initialize a variable of type wsm_info * with an rvalue of type WaveShortMessage

<p>INET is a fresh installation in a new workspace (/temp). I have another workspace where it works fine without any problem. There is also a third workspace where it was working fine and then suddenly after clicking on ""clean project"" for a different project that is using INET, it doesn't work anymore and it gives the same error as the one reported here.</p>

<p>I've been reading some posts from a couple years ago (2013) that indicate that OMNeT++ packages executables in 32-bit regardless. I configured OMNeT++ to not use clang and was able to make _popcnt32() work. </p>

<p>I would like someone to verify that OMNeT++ does still package everything in 32-bit and that it is the reason the 64-bit intrinsics won't work. However, if anyone knows of a workaround to allow for use of 64-bit intrinsics, I would appreciate any help with that.</p>

<p>Additionally, as illustrated by the following trace snippet, at the end of the simulation (time=10000) the IFQ of node 2 isfilled up with REQUESTS, eventhough there was plenty of time at the end of the simulation to empty the queue.</p>

<p>Any idea what is going on?</p>

<p>Update:
Apparently, at some point REQUEST messages are generated at RTR level but not being sent out and then traffic is dropped because the node didn't receive a route reply in time. Here's a trace example showing this:</p>

<pre><code>s 2417.739768850 _2_ AGT  --- 23 cbr 70 [0 0 0 0] ------- [2:0 0:1 32 0] [7] 0 0

<p>Note that in all examples where I encounter this problem, each time a CBR message is generated, the previous route has already expired and a new route has to be found. I think this might be causing a bug somewhere.</p>

<pre><code>  what():  (omnetpp::cModule): Object has no associated cComponentType (maybe omnetpp::cModule is not derived from cModule/cChannel?)
</code></pre>

<p>Indeed when I add this->getNumParams() in the constructor it returns 0. If I hard code the parameter, the initialization works fine so I assume I need to do something in order to load the parameters. I could, presumably put the parameters in omnetpp.ini or elsewhere but I would like to know why this does not work.Do I have to do something prior to calling create to load the params? Thanks,</p>

<p>Node1 is a transmitter and Node2 is a receiver.</p>

<p>Packet transmission starts at 2s in the simulation.</p>

<p>Considering the above, as long as my packets are &lt; 5000 bytes in size I am below the 4Mbps limit of the connection.</p>

<p>What I am trying to understand is what happens when I increase packet size beyond 5000 bytes.</p>

<p>So, if i increase packet size to 8000 bytes here is what happens, using NAM for the animation</p>

<p>The first packet is sent at 2s and the second is sent at 2.016s. Note that a packet is sent every 0.01s, so the 2nd packet should have been sent at 2.01s. Also notice that we are currently at 2.02+ seconds in the simulation, so the third packet should have already left Node1.</p>

<p>NAM's documentation says that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Queued packets are shown as little squares.[...] Dropped packets are shown as falling rotating squares, and disappear at the end of the screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I am not having any dropped packets?</p>

<p>Now, I can't quite understand the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the relation between the packet arrows length and the connection?</li>
<li>What does the fact that packet transmission does not happen at the set interval of 10ms mean?</li>
<li>What does the fact that I am pushing a transmission rate above 4Mbps mean for a connection limited to 4Mbps?</li>
<li>Why, in the graph, I see spikes and why do they go beyond 4Mbps?</li>

<p>The simulator knows both resource blocks and bands. A band is a logical collection of transmission frequencies. If <code>numBands == numRBs</code> then each band corresponds to one resource block.</p>

<p>So to try things out, I set <code>numRbs = 1 = numBands</code> and have two nodes. My scheduler simply assigns the first band to the first node, and then attempts to reassign the same band to the second node. The <code>SchedulingResult</code> tells me I should <code>TERMINATE</code> here - which seems like reassignment is not supported at all.</p>

<p>However, both nodes transmit UDP packets and if I run the simulation to the end, I find that both actually got to send out the same number of packets. Going through the logs I find that every 5th scheduling round (the number 5 might be specific to my setup), the second node still gets the <code>TERMINATE</code> answer, but is granted a resource block anyway. This seems to happen within the <code>eNodeB Main Loop</code>. How, why, what's going on? Does anyone know?</p>

<p>My question is, which module, or in what part destroying of dynamically allocated memory should occur in such cases.</p>

<p>For example, lets say I have the following module, which creates a packet encapsulated in another cPacket, and sends it to other module:</p>

    /* DO SOMETHING */

    delete msg;
    delete overlay_packet;

<p>But according to Omnet++ documentation, <code>decapsulate()</code> provides us with a memory duplication, so the <em>originally allocated memory</em> for <code>encapsulated</code> isn't really destroyed:</p>

<p><em>Taken from omnet simulation manual - <a href=""https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/manual/#sec:messages:reference-counting"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reference Counting</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>5.4.5 Reference Counting</strong></p>
  
  <p>Since the 3.2 release, OMNeT++ implements reference counting of
  encapsulated packets, meaning that if you dup() a packet that contains
  an encapsulated packet, then the encapsulated packet will not be
  duplicated, only a reference count incremented. <strong>Duplication of the</strong>
  <strong>encapsulated packet is deferred <em>until decapsulate()</em> actually gets</strong>
  <strong>called</strong>. If the outer packet is deleted without its decapsulate()
  method ever being called, then the reference count of the encapsulated
  packet is simply decremented. The encapsulated packet is deleted when
  its reference count reaches zero.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, it is not clear if when encapsulating in the first place, the encapsulated packet is cloned (so we can delete the allocated memory already at <code>X::initialize()</code>, after using <code>packet-&gt;encapsulated(...)</code>.</p>

<p>Documentation is a bit vague, but I think it means the the original address of <code>encapsulated</code> is pointed in the cPacket when encapsulating, so I can't delete in <code>X::initialize()</code> :</p>

<p><em>Taken from Omnet++ cPacket class reference - <a href=""https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp4/api/classcPacket.html#a60f2a48bf1d777342394acd3ddf9fbf3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cPacket encapsulate(..)</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>virtual void cPacket::encapsulate (   cPacket *   packet   )  [virtual]
  Encapsulates packet in the packet.</p>
  
  <p>The packet length gets increased by the length of the encapsulated
  packet.</p>
  
  <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: IT IS FORBIDDEN TO KEEP A POINTER TO A MESSAGE AFTER
  IT WAS ENCAPSULATED. For performance reasons, encapsulated packets are
  reference counted, meaning that the encapsulated packet is not
  duplicated when you duplicate a packet, but rather, both (all) copies
  share the same packet instance. Any change done to the encapsulated
  packet would affect other packets as well. Decapsulation (and even
  calling getEncapsulatedPacket()) will create an own (non-shared) copy
  of the packet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, to conclude:</p>

<p><strong>What is the correct place \ flow to destroy the allocated memory for <code>cPacket* encapsulated</code>?</strong></p>

1,0.3694,"file, set, parameter, number, module, trace, generate, script, random, position",43682904,3,"<p>I want to create and simulate a wired topology using NS2. Trying to write a tcl and positioning the nodes and links using rand() .
My solution was:</p>

<pre><code>### Create a simulator object
set ns [new Simulator]
set num_node 10
set num_flow 5
set x_dim 150
set y_dim 150

### Define different colors for data flows (for NAM)
$ns color 1 Blue
$ns color 2 Red

### Open the NAM trace file
set nf [open out.nam w]
$ns namtrace-all $nf
set tracefd [open out.tr w]
$ns trace-all $tracefd

### set up topography object
set topo [new Topography];            # This is needed for wireless
$topo load_flatgrid $x_dim $y_dim;    # Setting a 2D space for the nodes

### Define a 'finish' procedure
proc finish {} {
    global ns nf tracefd
    $ns flush-trace
    ### Close the NAM trace file
    close $nf
    close $tracefd
    ### Execute NAM on the trace file
    exec nam out.nam &amp;
    exit 0
}

#Create four nodes
for {set i 0} {$i &lt; [expr $num_node]} {incr i} {
    set n($i) [$ns node]
    puts ""Created node $i""
}

### Create links between the nodes
for {set i 0} {$i &lt; [expr $num_node + 1]} {incr i} {
    set s_node [expr int($num_node*rand())];     # src node
    set d_node $s_node
    while {$d_node==$s_node} { ;                 # while the random pair are same node
        set d_node [expr int($num_node*rand())]; # dest node
    }
    $ns duplex-link $n($s_node) $n($d_node) 2Mb 10ms DropTail
    $ns queue-limit $n($s_node) $n($d_node) 50
    puts ""Linking $s_node and $d_node""
}

### Give node position (for NAM)
set i 0
while {$i &lt; $num_node } {
    ### Set random position for nodes
    set x_pos [expr int($x_dim*rand())];   # random settings
    set y_pos [expr int($y_dim*rand())];   # random settings

    $n($i) set X_ $x_pos
    $n($i) set Y_ $y_pos
    $n($i) set Z_ 0.0
    puts ""Put $i to ($x_pos , $y_pos)""

    #puts -nonewline $topofile ""$i x: [$node_($i) set X_] y: [$node_($i) set Y_] \n""
    incr i;
}; 

### Setup UDP connections
for {set i 0} {$i &lt; [expr $num_flow]} {incr i} {
    set s_node [expr int($num_node*rand())];     # src node
    set d_node $s_node
    while {$d_node==$s_node} {;                  # while the random pair are same node
        set d_node [expr int($num_node*rand())]; # dest node
    }
    set udp($i) [new Agent/UDP]
    $udp($i) set class_ $i
    $ns attach-agent $n($s_node) $udp($i)
    set null($i) [new Agent/Null]
    $ns attach-agent $n($d_node) $null($i)
    $ns connect $udp($i) $null($i)
    $udp($i) set fid_ $i
    puts ""Flow $s_node - $d_node""
}

### Setup a CBR over UDP connections
for {set i 0} {$i &lt; [expr $num_flow]} {incr i} {
    set cbr($i) [new Application/Traffic/CBR]
    $cbr($i) attach-agent $udp($i)
    $cbr($i) set type_ CBR
    $cbr($i) set packet_size_ 1000
    $cbr($i) set rate_ 1mb
    $cbr($i) set random_ false
    puts ""setting cbr for $i""
}

### Schedule events for the CBR and FTP agents
for {set i 0} {$i &lt; [expr $num_flow]} {incr i} {
    $ns at 0.1 ""$cbr($i) start""
}

for {set i 0} {$i &lt; [expr $num_flow]} {incr i} {
    $ns at 4.5 ""$cbr($i) stop""
}

for {set i 0} {$i &lt; [expr $num_node]  } { incr i} {
    $ns initial_node_pos $n($i) 4
}

### Run the simulation
$ns run
</code></pre>

<p>But the randomization is often creating erroneous links and thus problem in simulation and getting this error :</p>

<pre>
--- Classfier::no-slot{} default handler (tcl/lib/ns-lib.tcl) ---

<p>But this is also random and does not occur always. When it does not occur , the nam file shows that there have been duplicate definition of nodes.
Can someone please just give me some guidance about how to create a random wired topology with random valid links?</p>

<p>Hi all, I have alternative solution for my problem and would like to write here for those who need to refer later. Instead of using gdb we can use valgrind. As my understanding, it is pretty good tool to detect bug related to memory allocation. To use valgrind in Omnet, you must make sure to have it installed in your OS (e.g., in Ubuntu, just type sudo apt-get install valgrind). Then in Omnet IDE, simply choose Profile As.. instead of Debug As.. then choose Omnet++Simulation, then trace bugs in valgrind windows. I did find where my bug is by this way. 
Thanks.

<p><strong>EDIT 3. SOLVED:</strong></p>

<p>There was a problem, because I manually created <code>Message</code> class (<code>Message.cpp</code> and <code>Message.h</code>) plus <code>Message.msg</code> as ""template"" so compiler had problem with this(multiple definition). This is what happen when you sit too long.</p>

After digging up Google, I got an idea that the error is related to 2 parameters: 
thinkTime 
idleInterval</p>

<p>They said as soon as they increased them, the problem is solved.</p>

<p>I was setting both at 1s; then tried to increase it to 2s, and 5s for both parameters, but the error still remains. </p>

<p>So is there anyone has faced this error and got rid of it, or has any idea to fix this error just share me please? I very much appreciate any help.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Hi all, let me update my solution for this problem, in case someone need to refer. So instead of using ephemeral local port which is limited in a range (1024--5000), I use normal port number by setting the parameter localPort, with initial value of 2000 then increases by 1 for every new socket. By setting that I don't see the error anymore, so I guess my simulation now can serve as much as the maximum port number supported in Omnet, e.g, 65535 ports. Thanks. </p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>I also tried to recreate the makefiles from my project but it doesnt work.</p>

<p>My .cc files use Register_Class() and Define_Module() properly but the Error Log keeps showing this error <strong> Class not found -- perhaps its code was not linked in, or the class wasn't registered with Register_Class(), or in the case of modules and channels, with Define_Module()/Define_Channel() -- in module (omnetpp::cModule)</strong></p>

<p>I really feel the problem has to do with the makefiles because when I import this application from my project to Veins src folder it works perfectly.</p>

<p>Ps.: I'm using OMNeT 5.1 + Veins 4.5 + Sumo 0.28</p>

I would like to use the RSSI value from the NIC as one of the metrics in the routing protocol. <br>
How can I retrieve the RSSI value for a specific neighbour node (identified by its MAC address) from the NIC ?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>

<p>After some digging in the INET 3.6 source code, I found that the Ieee80211NIC component is composed of the following modules (or layers) (in top-down order):<br></p>

<ul>
<li>agent (used only in infrastructure mode in a station STA)</li>
<li>mgmt (can be of type Ieee80211MgmtAP, Ieee80211MgmtSTA, Ieee80211MgmtAdhoc)</li>
<li>mac</li>
<li>radio</li>
</ul>

<p>I further analyzed the <strong>Ieee80211MgmtSTA</strong> source code, and found that it implements the following method, which records the received signal strength (<strong>bss.setRxPower(ap->rxPower)</strong>):</p>

<pre><code>void Ieee80211MgmtSTA::sendScanConfirm()
{
    EV &lt;&lt; ""Scanning complete, found "" &lt;&lt; apList.size() &lt;&lt; "" APs, sending confirmation to agent\n"";

    // copy apList contents into a ScanConfirm primitive and send it back
    int n = apList.size();
    Ieee80211Prim_ScanConfirm *confirm = new Ieee80211Prim_ScanConfirm();
    confirm-&gt;setBssListArraySize(n);
    auto it = apList.begin();
    //XXX filter for req'd bssid and ssid
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++, it++) {
        APInfo *ap = &amp;(*it);
        Ieee80211Prim_BSSDescription&amp; bss = confirm-&gt;getBssList(i);
        bss.setChannelNumber(ap-&gt;channel);
        bss.setBSSID(ap-&gt;address);
        bss.setSSID(ap-&gt;ssid.c_str());
        bss.setSupportedRates(ap-&gt;supportedRates);
        bss.setBeaconInterval(ap-&gt;beaconInterval);
        bss.setRxPower(ap-&gt;rxPower);
    }
    sendConfirm(confirm, PRC_SUCCESS);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, in case of the <strong>Ieee80211MgmtAdhoc</strong> type, the channel scanning (which is controlled by the agent module) is not implemented. Hence, it is not possible to retrieve the Rx Power for a specific node.</p>

<p>Has anybody managed to implement an agent module with channel scanning in the Adhoc mode ? <br>
Or is there an alternative way to get the RSSI information ? </p>

As it is explained in the API reference and in the manual - I need to define it<br>
as follows:<br>
<code>cQueue queue(""Name of queue"", someCompareFunc)</code>  </p>

<p>When <code>someCompareFunc</code> is of type <code>CompareFunc</code> which is defined by omnet as:<br>
<code>typedef int (*CompareFunc)(cObject *a, cObject *b);</code>  </p>

<p>So, I wanted to implement this comparative function, but didn't manage to write something that will compile.<br>
I admit I didn't work with function pointers for some time now, but after a small research, I think I do understand and did write some test codes with eclipse IDE (c++).</p>

<p>I'm trying to write the code at a <code>simpleModule</code> file.cc.<br>
So for every function I declare at the header file in the ""regular way"", in the .cc file I need to add the module name with ""::"" before the function's name.<br>
So in my header file I declared:<br>
<code>int compareByNodes (cObject *a, cObject *b);</code></p>

<p>And in the .cc file:  </p>

<pre><code>int JobScheduler::compareByNodes (cObject *a, cObject *b){
       return 1;
    };
</code></pre>

<p>My first try to define the cQueue was:  </p>

<pre><code>cQueue queue(""job_Buffer"",&amp;compareByNodes);
</code></pre>

<p>But I received a compilation error of: 'compareByNodes' was not declared in this scope.<br>
So I figured it must have something to do with the 'JobScheduler::' that is missing.<br>
The second try was:</p>

<pre><code>CompareFunc tmp = (CompareFunc)&amp;JobScheduler::compareByNodes;
cQueue queue(""job_Buffer"",tmp);
</code></pre>

<p>This time my errors were:<br>
""Multiple markers at this line<br>

<p>Adding parenthesis after the 'ampersand' didn't help either.  </p>

There is no problem to create the ned file. The Etherhost underlying model with EtherAppCli and EtherAppServ are found in the ned file. I have no errors by building the project.
But, I have always the error ""Class ""inet::EtherAppCli"" not found"" when I run the model. Can someone help me to solve this problem ? </p>

<p>For a university project i build a docker image containing Omnet++ to provide a consistent development environment. </p>

<p>The Image uses phusions's Baseimage and sets up x11 forwarding via SSH like rogaha did in his <a href=""https://github.com/rogaha/docker-desktop/blob/master/Dockerfile"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">docker-desktop</a> image. </p>

<p>The image works perfectly fine on a Linux Host System. But on Windows and OS X i was unable to ssh on the container from the host machine. </p>

<p>I reckon this is due to the different implementation of Docker on Windows and OS X. As explained in <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/container-networking#transparent-network"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> Article by Microsoft Docker uses a NAT Network for Containers as a default to Separate the Networks from Host and Containers. </p>

<hr>

<p>My problem is i don't know how to reach the running container via ssh. 
I already tried the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Change the Container Network to a transparent Network as described in the Microsoft Article. The following error occurs both in Windows and OS X: </li>
</ul>



<pre><code>docker network create -d transparent MyTransparentNetwork
Error response from daemon: legacy plugin: plugin not found
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>On Windows run Docker in Virtualbox instead of Hyper-V</li>
<li>Explicitly expose port 22 like this:</li>
</ul>

According to the <a href=""https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/PyViz"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">doc</a>, I have downloaded the three dependencies which are </p>

  <p>py27-pygtk<br>
  py27-pygoocanvas<br>
  py27-pygraphviz</p>

<p>Now in order to use this, I still need to enable the python bindings which I used <code>/usr/bin/python2.7 ./waf configure</code> wanna to check what needs for  enabling python bindings. The result shows that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python Bindings : not enabled (PyBindGen version not correct and newer version could not be retrieved) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I checked the <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyBindGen#downloads"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Doc</a> and downloaded PyBindGen (version <strong>0.18.0</strong>). The output shows </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Installed /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/PyBindGen-0.18.0-py2.7.egg

</blockquote>

<p>After I ran the configuration check the results still showed that <strong>PyBindGen version not correct and newer version could not be retrieved</strong>
So I presume that is that because I installed the wrong version of PyBindGen? If so how can I get the suitable version for enabling Python Binding? </p>

<p>I would appreciate if there is someone who can help me figure it out. Many thanks. </p>

<p>I am installing Omnet++, Veins, and Sumo on a virtual machine in Centos 7.  I have been through the installation of these three programs twice and I believe I have correctly completed all the steps, although I am pretty new to linux and could have made a mistake.</p>

<p>The library it failed to load is libosg.so.130.  This looks like an Open Scene Graph library.  I was getting a very similar error yesterday having to do with a osgEarth library.  I was able to get around this by disabling selinux, which was blocking some shared libraries from being accessed.  I tried the same solution with libosg with no avail.  Is there a different antivirus/firewall on Centos that I should turn off?  Or is there another idea I should look into?</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated!  Thanks!</p>

<p><code>station</code> is a foreign module and I may not apply changes to it.</p>

<p>so I could do this in omnetpp.ini:</p>

builds using cmake. So, to build it, every time I must switch to a
console, am I right? In fact, it builds ok for me.</li>
<li>However, this prevents me from debugging in OMNET++, am I right? I
know I can debug in console using gdb.</li>
<li>Finally, it seems the omnetpp.ini does not recognize several of its
entries, even if it considers them when running make run_example!
Please see the following image. This, of course, is unconvenient
since it disables the code completion for omnetpp.ini and it's
unpractical to see if the syntax the changes I want to apply to the

The only way that OMNeT++ seems to allow me to link the Crypto++ library is using the static version of the Crypto++ library like I describe below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Right clicking on Project->Properties->OMNeT++->Makemake->Option, from ""Target"" I choose ""Static Library(.lib or .a)""</li>
<li>From ""Compile"" I choose the directory where cryptlib.lib is located (C:\cryptopp565\Win32\DLL_Output\Debug)</li>
<li>From ""Link"" I choose the additional library ""cryptlib"". (The actual library file is ""cryptlib.lib"")</li>
</ul>

<p>All my encryption errors go away (so it seems like my crypto library is linked) and I can run the simulator, but the problem is when I run the simulation, the simulation hasn't updated from when I previously ran the simulator. I know I'm seeing the simulator run my previous (old) version of my project, from before I included a static library, because my old debug output plays even though I change the debug output using ""EV&lt;&lt;..."".</p>

<p>I don't think putting encryption into a simulator is a great idea, BUT this static-library-executing-old-simulator problem seems to happen regardless of what library I connect. So long as I select ""Static Library(.lib or .a)"" from the Target makemake page, even if I don't include a static library, the simulator doesn't update. When I go back to ""Target Type""->""Executable"" and build/run the simulator (and get rid of my link &amp; compile to cryptlib), the most up-to-date project gets simulated, but my crypto library isn't linked.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me fix my settings so the OMNeT++ simulator runs my most recently built project when I target a static library?</p>

<p>Next, I created a network compound module for the simulation. The code as follows:</p>

    @signal[DestinationNode_rcvdPk];
    @delegatesignal[rcvdPk](source=DestinationNode.udpApp[0].rcvdPk; target=DestinationNode_rcvdPk);

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>So after rebuilding the project and running omnetpp.ini, I got this error immediately: ""Error in module(SelfishBaseNode) VanetA.BadRNode1 (id=8) during network initialization: unknown parameter 'routing TableModule"".</p>

<p>I checked the debugger and apparently it stopped at this line in AODVRouting.cc:</p>

<pre><code>void AODVRouting::initialize(int stage)
{
.....
.....
routingTable = getModuleFromPar&lt;IRoutingTable&gt;(par(""routingTableModule""), this);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I was puzzled because I didn't override the initialize() function in SelfishBaseNode.cc. I thought the program had confused with the initialize() function between SelfishBaseNode.CC and AODVRouting.CC so I removed the initialize() function in SelfishBaseNode.h and .CC file but didn't help. Hopefully someone could shed some light on this problem. Thank you.</p>

The car VB will overtake the vehicle VA, but it should verify if there is any car coming from the opposite direction. In this case, VB cannot overtake because VC is coming from the opposite direction. Otherwise, VB can overtake VA , so it moves from the edge 1i to 1o and then return to 1i.</p>

<p>There is any other solution for this scenario ?</p>

<p>This code is as simple as I could think of (I'm new to OMNeT++). Here is the .ned file:</p>

<pre><code>simple Test
{
    gates:
}

network Bernoulli
{
    submodules:
        node: Test;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the omnetpp.ini file:</p>

<pre><code>[General]
network = Bernoulli
bernoulli-mean = 0.05
num-trials = 10000000
rng-class = ""cMersenneTwister""
seed-0-mt = ${seed=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
</code></pre>

<p>I am running the code with the command: <code>./exe_file -u Cmdenv -r 3</code> (I am intentionally picking out the third run). When I do this with the omnetpp.ini file above, I get about 532,006 successes (though THIS NUMBER CHANGES SLIGHTLY ON EACH RUN??). For 10^7 runs, this is about 46 standard deviations from the mean (computed using mean and variance of the binomial distribution). </p>

<p>Furthermore, if I comment out the line <code>rng-class=""cMersenneTwister""</code>, the number jumps to about 531,793 successes, again changing slightly (but not radically) each time. </p>

<p>Moreover, if I comment out the <code>seed-0-mt=...</code> line, then suddenly the simulation starts producing values within 0.06 std. dev. of the mean! This despite the fact that the OMNeT++ manual assures that using the cMersenneTwister algorithm means you can choose seeds at random, since the period is so large.</p>

<p>Why is this happening?? I would expect that (1) since cMersenneTwister is the default, including it in the omnetpp.ini file shouldn't change anything, and (2) that since I'm choosing the same seed each time (i.e. the seed 3), that I should be getting the same results. But I'm not! This confuses me, because the OMNeT++ manual states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the cMersenneTwister random number generator, selecting seeds so that the generated sequences don't overlap is easy, due to the extremely long sequence of the RNG. The RNG is initialized from the 32-bit seed value seed = runNumber*numRngs + rngNumber.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the vehicle travel with a speed of 1m/s, it spends approx 1000 seconds within the RSU transmission range and the total downloaded file is 48.0607MB.
What could be the reasons for the size of the downloaded file to remain constant despite using different bitrates (3Mbps, 6Mbps, 9Mbps, 11Mbps, 18Mbps)?</p>

<p>In the original erlangen.rou.xml of VEINS, I could control the number of vehicles either by using "" *.manager.numVehicles"" in the omnetpp.ini file or by using the ""number =198"" inside "" erlangen.rou.xml"". But when i use only 5 vehicles using "" *.manager.numVehicles = 5"" in omnetpp.ini file, there are multiple vehicles generated from the ""erlangen.rou.xml"". How can I use the desired number of vehicles.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>From logs I have concentrated on node 18. Two nodes that transmitted before 30 are 32 and 4. These 2 messages are received successfully by all 3 nodes. When a message arrives decider tries to set channel state as busy in processnewsignal and set idle after processing packet. This calls mac1609_4.cc channelBusy and channelIdle functions respectively. So the channelIdle variable is set accordingly. Also if channel is to be set busy it will stop contention and calculate currentBackoff if any packet is waiting to be transmitted. If channel is being set idle at the end of reception, startContent is called. Based on this only the lastIdle variable is set which is used to calculate nextMacEvent. So when the last successful message was received all the nodes which have a packet to send decide nextMacEvent and it is sent as self message in Mac1609_4.cc. on receiving the nextMacEvent self message we will start transmitting without checking if any other node has started transmission. We can not identify that probably because we are setting channel busy when we receive messages after some propagation delay. So between last successful transmission and nextMacEvent other nodes also take decision to transmit without checking current channel state. That's why the node has some receive events while sending. As far as my understanding goes before transmission we should sense current state of channel and retry backoff accordingly. We do not check this at the nextMacEvent. It looks like a collision behaviour but should we not check the current state of channel when backoff counter reaches zero and retry. Please correct me if I am wrong anywhere. </p>

<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>

<p>Any help or advice??</p>

<p><strong><em>My Learnings(probably last update):</em></strong>
After Some digging, these are my learnings if it helps some one. The basic CSMA mechanism says before attempting for transmission, the node has to sense the channel, initiate transmission if the channel is sensed idle for AIFS time, or go in to back off if channel is busy. In veins the channel busy status is stored in  idleChannel variable whose status is checked in Mac1609_4:channelBusySelf() function before initiating transmission (nextMacEvent in Mac1609_4::handleSelfMsg). The idleChannel is updated in Mac1609_4::channelBusy and Mac1609_4::channelIdle functions when a message reception starts and when message reception ends respectively. So when a previously transmitting node sends a packet, all the recieving nodes will receive the packet with varying delay i.e., starts receiving at different times and update their channelIdle variable. After that they calculate best time to transmit and starts transmission. It does check if channel is idle or not but as the channelIdle status is updated at next reception and because of transmission delay it takes some time between transmission start at sender and reception start at receiver side, both the transmitting nodes cant see other transmission. As far as I understand this is called a collision when more than two nodes start transmission at the same time. So the BitError statistic is set and statsTXRXLostPackets is also set. So while calculating totalLostPackets we can take only one of these two values.   </p>

<pre><code>if (sendBeacon) {

<p>2) Add this to handle self message :</p>

<p>I am implementing a scenario including one rsu and one vehicle moves from far away towards the rsu. When i used the same values as the veins example, all messages are received even when the vehicle was far. Then i tried to change the value of maximum interference and set it to 260 instead of 2600, what happened is that when the vehicle is far away the rsu doesn't receive any messages and when it come closer to the rsu it receive the message.

By following the README, I get into the root package and write:</p>

<pre><code>make makefiles    //this creates the required Makefile in inet, veins and simulte
make
</code></pre>

<p>This last command, however, results into a fatal error in building <strong>inet</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>In file included from applications/common/ApplicationBase.h:21:10: 
fatal error: 'OperationalBase.h': file not found
</code></pre>

<p>By opening the file 'inet/src/applications/common/ApplicationBase.h', I immediately realize that the problem lies in the inclusion of the 'OperationalBase.h', which, as a matter of fact, <strong>is not present in the same directory</strong>. Instead, it can be found in the 'inet/src/base/' directory.</p>

<p>Omnet++ : 5.2.
Veins-LTE: inet 2.3.0,   veins 2.1bis,  simulte 0.9.1 
SUMO: 0.30.0 (if this could be relevant)
Environment: Ubuntu 16.04.1 - amd64</p>

<p>I am perfectly conscious that a similar question already exists <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45459603/error-encountered-in-building-vein-lte-1-3"">here</a>, but it has not received answers nor comments since last August, so..</p>

<p><strong>WHAT I TRIED TO DO:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>My first action was simply to change the path in the include statement so that to point to the right folder: <code>#include ""../../base/OperationalBase.h""</code>; this actually shifts the problem elsewhere, since <strong>all</strong> the other source files in the 'inet' framework inside the veins-lte package do not include the full paths of the required header files (i.e., they seem to  assume all the .h files are inside the same directory). Moreover, the <code>omnetpp</code> methods are not recognized, since no <code>using namespace omnetpp</code> is present.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>I had a look at 'inet/Makefile' file; in particular, after changing to the 'src/' folder, the <code>opp_makemake</code> command comes with the following options:</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p><code>opp_makemake -f --deep --make-so -o inet -O out -pINET -
Xapplications/voipstream -Xtransport/tcp_lwip -Xtransport/tcp_nsc -
DWITH_TCP_COMMON</code> .... and other stuff sounding like -DWITH_</p>

<p>As per the <code>opp_makemake</code> documentation (<a href=""https://github.com/shigeya/omnetpp/blob/master/src/utils/opp_makemake"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">opp_makemake</a>), the <code>--deep</code> option should cater for deep includes. Does it mean that the full (or relative to <code>src/</code>) path of the <code>.h</code> file to be included is not required? The only source folders that are excluded seem to be <code>transport/tcp_lwip</code>, <code>applications/voipstream</code>, <code>transport/tcp_nsc</code>.</p>

<p>So, should I modify all source files by writing the full/relative path of the included files?
Is there a better, smarter, more centralized way to achieve this goal, maybe by modifying something in the <code>inet/Makefile</code> file?
Am I missing something very obvious?</p>

<p>Thank You </p>

<p>I think it is a ns3 problem, I have created a minimal working example:</p>

using namespace std;

// main() is where program execution begins.
int main() {

   cout &lt;&lt; ""Hello World""; // prints Hello World

<p><strong><em>Problem statement:</em></strong> I am trying to generate 'n' static RSU nodes with random initial positions. I am using <code>LinearMobility</code>and setting the speed etc. to 0 to achieve static-ness of RSUs. <strong>N.B.</strong> The vehicles are generated on fly from sumo through TraCI (this is working fine). <strong><em>The aim is to generate the RSUs such that, they are inside the area of the map, in the vicinity of where the vehicles are moving.</em></strong></p>

<p>But I am unable to do that. A lot of RSUs are generated, spread in the grey area (the playground) outside the map (which usually is at the bottom right corner), and I could not find a work around. (Being inexperienced with OMNET++) I strongly suspect this is wrong, because surely the road side units cannot be outside the map!</p>

<p>Is there a way such that the playground area can be aligned with the map area? If, yes then I think by knowing the 4 corner coordinates of the SUMO map, it should be possible to restrict the positions of the RSUs to the more or less within a rectangular Coordinate range. I would then use something like the following to generate RSUs: (#suppose the corners are [(1000,1000),(1500,1000),(1000, 1500),(1500,1500)])</p>

<p>I have a scenario where the RSUs will broadcast a fixed message '<strong>RSUmessage</strong>' about every T<sub>RSU</sub> seconds. I have implemented the following <strong>code for RSU broadcast</strong> (also, these fixed messages have Psid = -100 to differentiate them from others):</p>

<p>A car can receive these messages from other cars as well as RSUs. RSUs discard the messages received from cars. The cars will receive multiple such messages, do some comparison stuff and periodically broadcast a similar type of message : '<strong>aggregatedMessage</strong>'  per interval T<sub>car</sub>.  aggregatedMessage also have Psid=-100 ,so that the message can be differentiated from other messages easily. </p>

<p>I am scheduling the car events using self messages. (Though it could have been done inside handlePositionUpdate I believe). The handleSelfMsg of a car is following:</p>

<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong> With this setting, the simulation is very very slow. I get about 50 simulation seconds in 5-6 hours or more in Express mode in OMNET GUI. (No. of RSU: 64, Number of Vehicle: 40, around 1kmx1km map)</p>

<p>Also, I am referring to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43583044/veins-simulation-running-very-slow"">this</a> post. The OP says that he got faster speed by removing the sending of message after each RSU received a message. In my case I cannot remove that, because I need to send out the broadcast messages after each interval.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I think that this slowness is because every node is trying to sendDown messages at the beginning of each simulated second. Is it the case that when all vehicles and nodes schedules and sends message at the same time OMNET slows down? (Makes sense to slow down , but by what degree) But, there are only around 100 nodes overall in the simulation. Surely it cannot be this slow. </p>

<p><strong>What I tried</strong> : I tried using <code>sendDelayedDown(wsm-&gt;dup(), simTime()+uniform(0.1,0.5));</code> to spread the sending of the messages through out 1<sup>st</sup> half of each simulated second. This seems to stop messages piling up at the beginning of each simulation seconds and sped things up a bit, but not so much overall.</p>

<p><strong>Can anybody please let me know if this is normal behavior or whether I am doing something wrong.</strong> </p>

<p>Also I apologize for the long post. I could not explain my problem without giving the context.</p>

<p>I am using an up to date <strong>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</strong>, compiling with <strong>cmake 3.9.6</strong>, building Veins and Vanetza worked without issue. <strong>Omnet++ Version is 5.2</strong>. The code lines, the Error is referring to are: </p>

<p>However expecting a "")"" before line 207 makes no sense to me.<br>
Also, this Error did not appear when building Artery on a different System (Same OS) a few weeks earlier. Using an earlier revision of the source had no effect either.</p>

<p>Which is the best way to implement this in Veins? </p>

<p>I see the 2nd approach as more apt way. When a WSM is scheduled in SCH by the application layer, Veins adds them in to AC queue and send the back-logged messages during the next CCH  and then sends the messages generated during the next CCH (FIFO behaviour). This approach increases end to end delay for all the messages under heavy load. How is the delay actually defined for messages that are generated during SCH?</p>

<p>Any insights on best approach in this case?</p>

<p>From what I've learned so far, these are the options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Omnet++ user manual says we can use custom makefile for some source directory. So keeping RInside code in one source folder and a separate makefile and calling this makefile from veins top level makefile. I tried both of these approaches:  

<ol>
<li>copying some source files from RInside examples and makefile and changed the Build properties in IDE to exclude this folder from build </li>
<li>also used the option custom make file for this directory. But was not successful so far. May be i am not doing correctly.  </li>

<li>Implement all functionality using Rinside and make it a library (static/Shared). Use this library in veins. </li>

<p>hi, suggested methods are not working for CImg because it is not available as a library. For CImg.h only needs to be included in the source file. I did follow the hints given but no help.

<p>In veins demo app there is a logic to simulate accident and vehicles reroute on receiving warning message. I'm trying to understand how rerouting is working there. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42781147/regarding-dynamic-routing-in-veins"">This</a> post says re-routing is dynamic and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46373278/what-policy-is-based-vehicle-rerouting-in-case-of-accident"">here</a> is some more explanation of the scenario.</p>

<p>My question is while rerouting which routing algorithm veins uses? Is it the same using which road network is created? If I have to chechk behavior of different routing algorithms under same conditions, do I need to create same road network using different values for --routing.algorithm ?</p>

1,0.1705,"file, set, parameter, number, module, trace, generate, script, random, position",0,0,"<p>I'm trying to simulate a large number of randomly generated 802.15.4 networks. I start 250 FFDs, up to 50 RFDs and a PAN Coordinator. The transmission range is set to 40m, the topology size is 500m x 500m and the simulation ends after 1800s (30 minutes). Each RFD creates one CBR link to the PAN Coordinator starting at 0s and sending all through the simulation at 2s intervals. Packet size is 70 [bytes].</p>

<p>Now, for the important part - since it's a ""large"" simulation, I use the ""Scheduler/Heap"" scheduler. I say that this is important because I started to get errors of the form  (in retrospect, probably isn't important, but it was a mayor clue that something was wrong!):</p>

<p>""ns: scheduler going backwards in time from 'x' to 'y'""</p>

<p>So, normally, I dismembered the scheduler.cc, scheduler.h and heap.h files in a search for an answer. After a full 12 hours of debugging (I am neither a proficient Linux user, nor a good c++ programmer) I finally found the cause/symptom - a packet already contained in the heap would change (increase) it's time value. This would, of course, totally mess up the heap structure and eventually this packet would be extracted and processed, but the next packet would fail because it would have a smaller time value.</p>

<p>Now, this behavior is a telltale sign of a change-by-reference, and after a few more hours of pathetic attempts of using gdb, I managed to find the culprit - the <code>void Phy802_15_4Timer::start(double wtime)</code> function in wpan/p802_15_4phy.cc. It sets the uid_ of a ""nullEvent"" to 0 every time it's called AND has a single packet/event reference to it. Gotcha! Furthermore, I figured out that the CCAHandler implementation was the one to blame and tracked it down to a single method call - <code>void Phy802_15_4::PLME_CCA_request()</code> in the same file. I checked and, would you know it - the CCAH handler was still active (flag active in Phy802_15_4Timer) when its start method was called (again)!</p>

<p>Finally, here's my question: seeing as other methods check the ""active"" flag for other handlers before actually invoking the start function (and, subsequently, calling the cancel method of said handler if it's active at that moment), I modified the code the the function in question to the following:</p>

<pre><code>void Phy802_15_4::PLME_CCA_request()
{
    if (trx_state == p_RX_ON)
    {
        // THIS IS WHAT I ADDED - START
        if(CCAH.active) {
            CCAH.cancel();
        }
        // THIS IS WHAT I ADDED - END

        //perform CCA
        //refer to sec 6.7.9 for CCA details
        //we need to delay 8 symbols
        CCAH.start(4/getRate('s')); // 2.32 change: start CCA at the end of 4th symbol
    }
    else
        mac-&gt;PLME_CCA_confirm(trx_state);
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this change, I get no more errors (yay!). But, I'm not sure if this is a valid change... My knowledge of both NS2 and 802.15.4 is very limited and I need this to work, but at the same time, I'm afraid to touch anything for the risk of getting experimental results that are - wrong!</p>

<p>Is this an OK approach? Any help would be hugely appreciated!</p>

<p>I want to program the node behavior by myself. When a message arrives at a host, i want to define in the <code>handleMessage(cMessage *msg)</code> method, whether the host should transmit the received message via Ethernet or Wireless interface.</p>

<p>Can i take the WirelessHost from the INET package for this scenario? If yes, how can i program the decision on what interface to use for retransmitting the received message? I followed the wireless tutorial from INET, but they only configure <code>.ned</code> and <code>.ini</code> files but not the <code>.cc</code> files where the behavior is coded.</p>

<p>In the tutorial the <code>UdpBasicApp</code> was used. It would be nice if i could write an own App like described above.</p>

The peculiarity of my scenario is that, using <strong>JSVM</strong> software, I obtain a text file corresponding to the trace video packets encoded using <strong>H.264/SVC</strong>. After a little bit of post processing, I get an input file suitable for network simulation; then, I try to reconstruct the trace with the packets at the receiver, and after that of course I elaborate some metrics to compare different transmission strategy.<br>
However, last update on JSVM seems to quite <a href=""https://github.com/floriandejonckheere/jsvm/tree/master/JSVM/H264Extension"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">old</a>. In fact, if some (<strong>not fundamental</strong>) packets are missing from the received trace, the bitstream is reconstructed but video decoding procedure won't finish (which to me seems counter-intuitive given H.264 decoding policies).<br>
This means that I can potentially obtain inconsistent metrics.</p>

<p>I tried also <strong>ffmpeg</strong> for the bitstream processing procedure, but in this case it doesn't recognize the enhancement quality layer which I encoded in my video-stream.</p>

<p>Given all the listed problems, I would like to know if there's any software that, given a video with any extension as input, it returns as output a text file corresponding to the packet trace. Moreover, it is important that it can do also the reverse process: from a packet trace text file, it must reconstruct the bit stream.</p>

<p>I'm implementing a simulation for a dynamic distributed storage network, which requires at certain points, that the connections between the modules vary. (e.g. client connects to a node (establishes a new connection) and wants to work with his data, stored on different nodes).</p>

<p>Is there is possibility to establish connections between unconnected but existing gates of two nodes at runtime?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>simple node1 {
  parameters:
      @display(...);
  gates:
    input in @loose;
    output out @loose;
}

simple node2 {
  parameters:
    @display(...);
  gates:
    input in @loose;
    output out @loose;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards there would be a boring network definition with no connections. (Don't know if it is possible to have a completely blank definition, but for the minimal example we assume it)</p>

<p>In the C++ file for the modules I wish to create a connection between these nodes depending on a certain condition like (pseudo code):</p>

<pre><code>if(condition){
  node1-&gt;setConnection(ownGate(""out""),node2-&gt;getGates(""in""),true);
}else{
  node1-&gt;setConnection(ownGate(""out""),node2-&gt;getGates(""in""),false);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've read the simulation manual of Omnet++ but really can't figure out what to do here ... </p>

<p>Is it possible at all to do this? And how?</p>

<p>These results are not correct, because Node 0 should be the one with more enery consumption by far due it has to cordinate the network and there  should be an incremental increase of energy consumption from 9 to 1 being 9 the node with less energy consumption.</p>

<p>For what i see in the results that i got from Castalia, seems that the static routing is not working , since node 1 and 2  has less energy consumption because are in range to comunicate with node 0 and the other nodes consume the maximoun amount of energy defined due to the distance with the coordinator.</p>

In another word, no vehicle is using the application. I tried two ways to do this. First, I use SUMO only to run the simulation, and secondly I use SUMO, Veins and OMNeT++ to run the simulation, but in <code>omnetpp.ini</code> set the penetration rate to 0 by <code>*manager.penetrationRate = 0</code>. I assume doing so will not create any mobility module for the vehicle running in SUMO. </p>

<p>But what confused me is the results of the above two simulations are not the same. The congestion in the first way (SUMO only) is much heavier than it in the second way (SUMO, Veins, and OMNeT++). Can anyone help me explain this? Aren't they supposed to yield the same result, since I set the penetration rate to 0? </p>

<p>What I want to know is how can I calculate the coverage radius of each node or how can I change the default value to something around 50-100m, what parameters do I need to change and what formula and propagation model does ns2 uses to calculate that.
I have moved the values of gamma from 2.0 to 5.0 and I have noticed that the coverage radius has decrease but I want to be able to know the exact distance.
Also the value of Pt inside that tcl is given en mW?</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>I am calling the flooding in the initialize method of the floodingModule like this:</p>

<pre><code>    for (GateIterator i(this); !i.end(); i++) {
        cGate *gate = *i;
        if (gate-&gt;getType() == cGate::OUTPUT) {
            SimpleMessage *csmsg = smsg-&gt;dup();
            send(csmsg, gate);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I am facing is, that the flooding only happens on the first link that is created. This means, there must be a problem mapping the compound module gates to the submodule gates, or not? Am I doing something wrong here which is obvious? Do you need more code?</p>

<p>Thanks for any advice!</p>

0,0.2396,"packet, message, send, node, receive, application, multiple, datum, specific, server",0,0,"<p>I am working on a wireless routing protocol. I have created a Queue at every node. In this queue, every node kept packet which it already transmitted. If packet is not transmitted by nexthop then previous node will retransmit the packet after timeout. The problem is that when node is trying to retransmitt the packet by calling postRotingHook in handle function to retransmit then it is not doing anything. This postRoutingHook is created locally so it is not actually sending the packet. So how to connect this packet with network for retransmission?</p>

<p>Example: Suppose We have 3 nodes A, B and C. A is source, B is intermediate and C is destination. Node A sent a packet initially. Now node B will forward it to node C. At this time node A will overhear this packet and it will cancel the timer and delete this packet from its Queue. (in normal condition)</p>

<p>Suppose node B could not forward the packet because of some reason then node A should re-transmit the packet after time out. I am unable to achieve this functionality.</p>

<p>My programming scenario is:
I have modified GPSR protocol. Where header file have definition of these 5 INetfilterHooks methods. I didn't use any control packet e.g. request, response, beacon etc. I am directly dealing with data packet which contains some control information. I have implemented my logic in datagramPreRoutingHook() method (when data is received from lower layer) and  datagramLocalOutHook() method (when data is received from upper layer).</p>

<p>Source node (at network layer) receives packet from upper layer at IPv4.cc using handlePacketFromHL() ->datagramLocalOutHook(datagram, destIE, nextHopAddr) == INetfilter::IHook::ACCEPT) when it calls datagramLocalOutHook(datagram, destIE, nextHopAddr) then control goes to my routing protocol. It makes necessary changes, Adds source, destination address, creates options and keeps the packet in Queue (for retransmission by scheduling timer) then return ACCEP. Then control again goes to IPv4.cc.</p>

<p>After this process, if time out occurs at my protocol then I am unable to send packet to IPv4.cc. I called postRoutingHook to retransmit the packet then it simly return ACCEPT (as defined in header file) and does nothing. I have tried to call some methods of IPv4.cc by making object of IPv4 in my protocol but these methods are protected so I couldn't access these methods.
I tried with making some public methods of IPv4.cc but it is giving error at further stage.</p>

<p>I have tried to make the object of INetfilter::IHook for calling its postRoutingHook() but is also providing error as object of abstract class can not be created.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I wrote a simple MWE that would work without the simulator, just to check the logic. It works flawlessly. This is definitely not a C++ issue but a Veins or OMNET++ issue.</p>

<li>I called methods on <code>llsConf</code> that indeed returned garbage values;</li>
<li>I checked values of <code>m_allocationChannelCount</code> and <code>m_slottedAlohaControlRandomizationIntervalInMilliSeconds</code> that were <strong>not</strong> the same as the return values from the methods of <code>llsConf</code>;</li>
<li>I checked in upper frames the values on <code>m_llsConf</code> which were as expected;</li>
<li>I checked the content of the objects in both frames that differed in the caller and the callee; the content of <code>llsConf</code> having a suspiciously large amount of attributes set to <code>0</code>.</li>

I assumed perfect communication between vehicles and intersection agent in the simulation. Now I want to simulate the realistic communication using veins. However, after reading many posts and followed the veins tutorial successfully, I still don't have a clear idea how to implement it. </p>

<p>Roughly I learned that I have two options:<br>
1. implement the algorithm using TraCIDemo11p files for car's behavior and TraCIDemoRSU11p files for the intersection agent. The problem is I need to do everything again using C++ and I am not an expert in C++.<br>
2. I read a post:

<p>The problem asked in the email is very similar to my problem. Christoph provided the following solution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For such complex interaction, it is perhaps best to bundle all 
  multiplexing functionality in your Python script and run the
  simulation  without traci-launchd. </p>
  
  <p>When Veins starts, it will try to connect to a configured TraCI server
  (localhost on TCP port 9999 by default), then send a TraCI command 
  instructing the server to start SUMO, followed by a number of 
  subscription requests. </p>
  
  <p>In the course of your simulation, Veins will repeatedly send CMD_SIMSTEP 
  commands and wait for subscription results (i.e., nodes departing, 
  moving, arriving). </p>
  
  <p>Your script could delay passing each CMD_SIMSTEP commands from Veins to 
  SUMO (and relaying the results back to Veins) until it is ready to 
  process the next timestep. </p>
  
  <p>If your script listens on port 9999, reads TraCI commands, discards
  the  very first message, then passes the remaining commands to an
  (already)  running instance of SUMO, it can serve as this multiplexing
  point.</p>
  
  <p>you can use a single additional stream of TraCI messages from Veins to your script 
  that updates its stored copy of connectivity information at every time step.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, I need to make veins and my simulation code both connect to SUMO. Every time veins reads movement traces from SUMO and simulate communication one timestep, then my algorithm reads communication data from veins and vehicle data from SUMO, then sends control command to SUMO. Finally, SUMO simulates one timestep and goes back to veins.</p>

<p>My questions are:<br>
1. Are my understanding correct? Are these two approaches feasible?
2. I prefer the 2nd approach since it might need less time. But I don't know how can I separate CMD_SIMSTEP command from the data veins sends to SUMO? I believe I should modify forward_connection() function in sumo-launchd.py, but I am not sure how to change the data variable.
3. For the copy of connectivity information in veins, I don't have a clue where to get them? </p>

<p>Thank you so much for your help.</p>

<p>Update: from SUMO documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The client has to trigger each simulation step in SUMO using the TraCI/Control-related commands#Command 0x02: Simulation Step command. If any subscriptions have been done, the subscribed values are returned. The simulation will advance to the next once all clients have sent the simulation step command. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for the 2nd question, does this mean I don't need to modify anything in forward_connection() function. I only need to figure out how to connect SUMO with both clients (omnetpp and my algorithm program)?</p>

<p>Update: I was able to follow veins tutorial successfully and now I am able to modify sumo-launchd.py to allow another client to connect with SUMO. I am trying to find out how to get the communication data from veins/omnetpp.</p>

Now, I would like to schedule many accidents in the ini file in order to measure the impact of collisions. For example, instead of </p>

<p>have something like </p>

  <p>*.node[*10].veinsmobility.accidentCount = 1</p>
  
  <p>*.node[*13].veinsmobility.accidentCount = 1</p>
  
  <p>*.node[*16].veinsmobility.accidentCount = 1</p>

<p>where all the accidents are scheduled at the same time. The cars enter the network with a period of 3.</p>

<p>I have tried, but just one among the three nodes (always the second one - node[13]) really stops and implement the code related to accidentSchedule. All the other cars stop but don't send anything and instead other random cars (differents from the nodes scheduled), implement the accidentSchedule. Here is what I have at the moment of the accident:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>** Event #107  t=106  RSUExampleScenario.node[10].veinsmobility (TraCIMobility, id=70)  on selfmsg scheduledAccident (omnetpp::cMessage, id=156)</p>
  
  <p>** Event #108  t=106  RSUExampleScenario.node[13].veinsmobility (TraCIMobility, id=88)  on selfmsg scheduledAccident (omnetpp::cMessage, id=200)</p>

<p>What shows that all the scheduled nodes schedule the accident but don't do what expected.</p>

<p>Please, any idea on what I am doing wrong?</p>

<p>So There are a number of objects in the robot simulator, and they communicate with each other using 802.11 which will be simulated by omnet++. Each node in omnet++ corresponds to each object in the robot simulator, and an object's movement will be synchronized with the corresponding node in omnet++.</p>

<p>But since omnet++ is a discrete event simulator, I need to deal with the clock mismatch problem between omnet++ and the robot simulator.</p>

<p>I know omnet++ has cRealTimeScheduler class for synchronizing simulation clock to wall clock, but I'm not sure if this will do what I want.</p>

<p>I'm a noob when it comes to network simulation, so I want to know if this is even possible or not. Does using cRealTimeScheduler class take care of clock synchronization? or do I need to take a different tack? (a different scheduler, or even a different simulator?)</p>

<p><strong>erlangen.net.xml</strong> is unchanged and in <strong>omnetpp.ini</strong> I have changed <strong>*.connectionManager.maxInterfDist</strong> from 2600m to 100m only.</p>

<p>Using these configurations I have ran the simulation using A* and CHWrapper algorithm but output of both is ditto copy. In below image it is visible that node 25 - 29 followed a different path after rerouting, but these are same in both cases.</p>

<p>Now following is revolving in my mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are routing algorithms applied successfully (set in erlangen.sumo.cfg) or in both cases default Dijkstra was used?</li>
<li>Routing algorithms applied successfully but results are same because network was not congested enough / don't have enough alternate paths to follow. So I should have change network, with multiple accident count etc.</li>
<li>I'm not getting how rerouting is working here.</li>

<p>About the behavior of the EDCA in the mac layer in WAVE, in my understanding the waiting time to send can be obtained by the following calculation.</p>

<p>waiting time = AIFS[AC] + backoff<br>
AIFS[AC] = SIFS + AIFSN[AC] * slotlength</p>

<p>However, in the startContent function of Mac 1609_4.cc, it is written as follows</p>

<pre><code>if (idleTime &gt; possibleNextEvent) {

But when we started running the program，use linux command ""top"" to see memory utilization, it will be increasing; and when we output the <code>m_unscheduledEvents</code>，the ++ is much more than --，that means the <code>SendStuff()</code> is increasing.

As a first step, I would like to create a network layout of a random graph. Meaning that each node will connect to 8 nodes picked at random out of all the nodes in the network. The problem is that I'm not sure how to implement this in the NED file. The nodes should connect with each other using the TCP protocol but on the other hand, I'd like to approach the internet routing as a black box. In addition, I would have thousands of nodes, which requires some kind of routing abstraction. Any ideas on how to approach this?</p>

<p>Another issue is that I'd like each node to have a bandwidth limitation. I could only find a way to limit the data link, which is not suitable for my case as each node has 8 out links and I want the bandwidth to be shared across all the links.

<p>I thought maybe my omnet++ installation is not complete, but I tried to reinstall the OMNET++ from the official page, and I updated QT recently but it doesn't work. QT can be ran independently. The images required by the error code doesn't exist in the directory, but I didn't call them in my code, how can a simple tic-toc need such images?
What should I do now?
this guy have the same problem but it is still unsolved...

<p>The runtime error is produced when the simulator tries to load the LinkLayer.</p>

<p>Runtime Error: <code>getContainingNicModule(): nic module not found (it should have a property named nic) for module 'network.componenet1.Link'  ... during network initialisation</code></p>

<p>What I believe the function <code>getContainingNicModule</code> is trying to do is look for a network interface card module that is a parent of the link layer.
I have searched for the <code>nic</code> property and cannot find anything. It may be related to the <code>interface</code> property but the <code>inet.LinkLayerNodeBase</code> that I am mirroring off has no such property.</p>

<p>Why does it give this error?</p>

3,0.3137,"vein, omnet, vehicle, sumo, change, rsu, car, scenario, simulation, speed",54891688,1,"<p>I'm trying to run a pedestrian simulation from sumo in omnet++. To keep it easy (i am a beginner) I decided to use the <em>Erlangen</em> example provided with veins and extend it with a couple of pedestrians. I added the pedestrians in sumo and ran it. It works perfectly fine:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Yo67.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">You can see the pedestrians and cars in this picture</a></p>

<p>Next I was trying to run the whole thing in omnet++. I also managed to do that but the pedestrians were not shown. Just the cars. I read these two topics:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51597697/communication-between-a-car-and-a-pedestrian-in-veins"">Communication between a car and a pedestrian in Veins</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47515408/veins-multiple-applications-in-multiples-vehicle-types"">Veins Multiple Applications in multiples Vehicle types</a></li>
</ul>

<p>and added these lines into the <em>omnetpp.ini</em> of the example:</p>

<pre><code>*.manager.moduleType = ""vtype0=org.car2x.veins.nodes.Car ped_pedestrian=org.car2x.veins.nodes.Pedestrian""
*.manager.moduleName = ""vtype0=carNode ped_pedestrian=pedestrianNode""
*.manager.moduleDisplayString = ""vtype0=carNode ped_pedestrian=pedestrianNode""
</code></pre>

<p>I also changed every appearance of ""node"" in <em>omnetpp.ini</em> to ""carNode"" and created new entries for ""pedestrianNode"" and I duplicated the <em>Car.ned</em> file and changed the file name to <em>Pedestrian.ned</em> and the module name to ""Pedestrian"". Then I ran the whole thing again but nothing changed except that the cars' image (as shown in the simulation) changed to a grey box. </p>

<p>Why are the pedestrians not shown? (Did I miss something?)
Do I have to tell veins (or sumo) to communicate pedestrian positions to omnet++?
Why did the icon of the cars in the simulation change to a grey box?</p>

<p>Here are the files that I added/modified:</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I researched the <a href=""https://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/TraCI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TraCI definition</a> and debugged the [source code of veins].

<p>I compared that to the TraCI documentation on the sumo wiki:<br>

<p>It seems to me that pedestrians are not included there since the persons/pedestrians have a different api (<a href=""https://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/TraCI/Person_Value_Retrieval"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/TraCI/Person_Value_Retrieval</a>) which is not listed on the subscription page (<a href=""https://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/TraCI/Object_Variable_Subscription"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/TraCI/Object_Variable_Subscription</a>).</p>

<p>Is there something I missed in the source code of veins where person subscription is done?</p>

<p>Does anybody know what can I do to make this work, or if I'm using the wrong approach to achieve the changing of the traffic lights colours.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

I need to change a traffic light's, of which I have an id, colour. However, I need to change only a specific part of the traffic light, for example, in an intersection I need to change to green the light that allows the cars to go from south to east, while blocking all other vehicles. I found a solution, which is to use the function <code>setState</code> to alter these values and it works, but after that the colours remain the same, not presenting the same behavior as before, despite altering the state to the previous one.
In conclusion, I need to alter the traffic light colours for a limited time and I can't achieve that.
Thanks in advance!</p>

I am quite new to ns-3 and networking below transport layer in general so I have gotten a bit lost trying to figure this out. </p>

<p>I want to use the emulated network to test the characteristics of different application layer IoT protocols (such as AMQP, MQTT, CoAP) in different networking scenarios and therefore I want the client and server application to be able to connect to each other the same way they would when using real networks. Some of the protocols use TCP and some use UDP and I want to be able to use the network emulation in the same way for both. Therefore the ideal scenario for me would be for the emulation to only work on the network layer and below, so that TCP connections would be able to be established directly between the client and server, with any eventual forwarding not occurring above the networking layer. Is this possible in ns-3 or do I need to do forwarding on the transport layer? </p>

<p>I have made forwarding of UDP packets work between a real client and server through an ns-3 emulation using TapFdNetDevices but as I described above this would not work for the case of TCP connections. Even if I rewrote this module to use TCP the tested scenario would not really be realistic since there would be three separate TCP connections (Client &lt;--> ns-3 client, ns-3 client &lt;--> ns-3-server, ns-3 server &lt;--> Server), each with its own connection setup and congestion control. If forwarding were to be done at the network layer, this could all be avoided, but I cannot figure out how to do that.</p>

<p>I have also looked at the code for ipv4-forwarding-test.cc inside the internet module but that seems to use UDP to forward packets.</p>

<p>Any help I can get would be appreciated!</p>

</ol>

<p><strong>My Question:</strong></p>

<p>How to -really- change the transmission range of just some nodes?<br>
From the links above, I knew that the term ""transmission range"", technically, is related to the received power, noise,sensitivity threshold, etc. which defines the probability of reception.</p>

<p>Since I am new to veins (and omnet++ as well), I did few tests and I concluded the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>""TraCIMobility"" module can adjust the nodes' parameters (for each vehicle, there is an instance) such as the ID, speed, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>I could, also, instantiate the ""Mac1609_4"" (for each vehicle) and changed some of its parameters like the ""txPower"" during simulation run-time but <strong>it had no effect on the real communication range</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>I could not instantiate (because it was global) the ""connection manager"" module which was the only responsible of (and does override) the effective communication range. this module can be configured in the "".ini"" file but I want different transmission powers and most importantly ""can be changed during run-time"".</p></li>
<li><p>The formula to calculate the transmission range is in the attached links, I got it, but it must be a way to define or change these parameters in one of the layers (even if it is in the phy layer, i.e., something like the attached signal strength...) </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Again, maybe there is some wrong ideas in what I have said, I just want to know what/how to change this transmission range.</p>

<p>I have two questions regarding OMNET++ output results</p>

<p>1- I have a simulation that uses AODV routing protocol in VANET network, but
when I record pcap for this simulation, it's shown as corrupted or damage even when I spill it to multi pcap file. How can I solve that? is the Inet pcap support AODV?</p>

<p>2-Is there a way to write this output (in below pic) to a text file or exported as excel format (I highlighted with red color).
I need all the information (event #, time, Relevant hop, name, info). I can copy it but it takes a time when I have around 10000 events?</p>

I followed the instructions from the README file to build the code with <code>cmake</code> and <code>make all</code>. Then, I tried to follow the instructions from the <em>Use NetworKit as a library</em> section, but the examples presented there are not consistent with the source code. In particular, the directory <code>NetworKit/graph</code> does not contain the <code>Graph.h</code> file. There is a <code>Graph.hpp</code> file, but in another directory. Also, the <code>LibDemo.cpp</code> file is missing. Is the README file outdated or I am missing something here?</p>

<p>EDIT<br>
This is an update to my post above. Apparently the README file is not up to date. In any case, I built the C++ Core of NetworKit. I included the library in my OMNeT++ application as follows:<br>
<code>#include &lt;graph/Graph.hpp&gt;</code><br>
In OMNeT++, in my project <code>Properties | OMNeT++ | Makemake</code>, and then selecting <code>src | Options | Custom</code>, I added the following:  </p>

<pre><code>INCLUDE_PATH += -I/path/to/networkit/include/networkit
LIBS += -L/path/to/networkit/build_lib -lnetworkit
</code></pre>

<p>When I build my OMNeT++ project, I get the following error:  </p>

<p>I have a server app (similar to <code>TcpGenericServerApp</code>). It accepts messages (subscriptions) and does not answer immediately. The connection stays open. When some event occurs it will send a notification to all connected clients.</p>

<p>The clients then have to analyze the packet contents. Here is my message definition:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>namespace inet;

enum PacketType
{
   SUBSCRIBE = 0;
   PUBLISH = 1;

// 
// Message class for event notification service based on TCP.
// 
class EventNotificationMsg extends FieldsChunk
{
    int type @enum(PacketType);
    string awesomeName;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty easy so far. The problem is that the packet size is 1000B. This packet will be split up by TCP into two segments. Now I have to defragment these packets to convert them to <code>EventNotificationMessage</code>. How do I do that? Or is there an easier way to extract <code>awesomeName</code> without having to defragment the packets.</p>

<p>Some more context:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm using <code>TcpAppBase</code></li>
<li>When I simply try conveting the incomplete packet I get the following error: <code>Returning an incomplete chunk is not allowed according to the flags: 4</code></li>
<li>I tried to defragment it using <a href=""https://inet.omnetpp.org/docs/developers-guide/ch-packets.html#fragmenting-packets"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> example but it produced a different error: <code>Implicit chunk serialization is disabled to prevent unpredictable performance degradation (you may consider changing the Chunk::enableImplicitChunkSerialization flag or passing the PF_ALLOW_SERIALIZATION flag to peek)</code>. The code that I used is below.</li>

Specfically, I receive other IPv4 packets from another simulator and seek a way to inject this packet into a INET4 simulation.</p>

<p>I have already an interface that allows to synchronize the OMNeT++ simulation engine with the co-simulation environment, and I have working code that reads an encoded IPv4 packet via the co-simulator's data exchange bus and de-serializes it into a INET4 cPacket structure. Also, I can setup the simulation in such a way that the IPv4 packet I receive has the valid IPv4 address of the <code>StandardHost</code> class instance within the OMNeT++ simulation. What I still lack is a way to have a <code>StandardHost</code> transmit this packet within the simulation.</p>

<p>So, basically, I need a way to attach my own ""co-simulation module"" to a <code>StandardHost</code> and use my own module's instance to send a cPacket object via the <code>StandardHost</code> instance my module belongs to – and that for several hosts in an inet4 simulation.</p>

<p>Can somebody please help me how to do this?  Which classes in the inet4 framework do I need to look at? What module do I need to dervice from in a NED file to register my module in an <code>omnetpp.ini</code> file?

<p>The above allows all the values I need to go into the process. However, inside the process some values are assigned (to a list) and no longer needed to be looped through. A brief snippet from the process: </p>

<p>This is the end of a loop in the process. The <code>puts</code> is just a marker, but it checks if an item is contained in either of 2 two lists. If it is in either list, increment it, and move on the next possible value. That value needs to no longer be checked/looped through because it has already been put inside a list. </p>

<p>How do I prevent the value from continuing to be used? The 'process calling' loop will ALWAYS override what happens in the process, so even assigned values will continue to be used. Is there a different way to call processes in Tcl? Or at least, a different way to feed values to a process in Tcl? Or I guess, pull them out?</p>

<p>The receiving node computes the delay using the wsm creation time, but I have also tried setting the timestamp on the transmitting side. The result is the same.</p>

<pre><code>simtime_t delay = simTime() - wsm -&gt; getCreationTime();
delayVector.record(delay);
</code></pre>

<p>The sample output for the delay vector is as follows:</p>

<p>Item#   Event#  Time             Value<br>
0       165     14.400239402394  2.39402394E-4<br>

<p>Which means that the end-to-end delay (from creation to reception) is equivalent to roughly a quarter of a millisecond, which seems to be quite low - and a fair bit below what is typically reported in the literature. This seems to be consistent with what other people have reported as being an issue (e.g. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32044168/end-to-end-delay-in-veins"">end to end delay in Veins</a>)</p>

<p>Am I missing something in this computation? I have tried adding load on the network by adding a high number of vehicular nodes (21 nodes within a 1000x50 sandbox on a straight highway, with an average speed of 50 km/h), but the result seems to be the same. The difference is negligible. I have read several research papers that suggest that end-to-end delay should increase dramatically in high vehicular densities.</p>

<p>I have already tried adding Node numbers and set node 0,8,16,24,32... as hub and set recipientID of other nodes to hubs in application layer. But in this way I have to set positions manually which costs a lot of time, and some nodes still receives messages from other WBAN.
As for multi-channel, I tried to assign a channelID to each nodes, run several times each time with one channelID and return in startup function if the channelID of this node don't match the channelID in run.In this way, it is hard to collect information from such a huge data result, and sometimes some node just can't receive any packet.I tried to debug hard but I can't figure it out.</p>

We are trying to implement an algorithm in the demo scenario (TraCIDemo11p) regarding message diffusion and our problem is with sending WSM messages. We want to send a specific message from a Node (e.g. car) to a specific RSU. The Node knows its neighbours by collecting beacon messages and stores the ID and type of sender to a buffer. The problem is when we want to send the message to, for example RSU with ID 7, if there is a Node with ID 7, two messages will be sent, because they both have ID 7. Where can we change the IDs that are given implicitly, so that we can differentiate the nodes and RSUs in the TraCIDemo11p.cc?</p>

<p>Because they are two different modules, the nodes are stored in an array node[] and RSUs in the array rsu[], that's why they can have the same ID or index for that matter.</p>

<p>We have tried by changing the myId attribute in the initialize method of TraCIDemoRSU11p, but when the message is about to be sent, the recepient does not receive it. By analyzing the beacon messages received by the car, we can tell that the RSU has the modified ID, 50 for example. Then we use the populateWSM method and state the rcvID parameter to be 50, but the message is never received on the RSU.</p>

I am able to add the label and change the color of the nodes correctly (although color requires 2 lines). However, I would like to make that node a square AND change the label color (the label color is lime green and difficult to read). Seems simple... via the manual/internet/sources out there, I have generated the following code to accomplish this:</p>

<pre><code>set stime 0.0

#color works... but requires BOTH these lines 
$ns at $stime ""$BS color darkgreen""
$BS color darkgreen

#shape does NOT work. Shape stays a circle
$ns at $stime ""$BS shape square""
$BS shape square

#Label works 
$ns at $stime ""$BS label \""BASE STATION\""""

#label color does NOT. Moves the node to position 0,0
$ns at $stime ""$BS label-color black""
$BS label-color black;


#base station position
set bsx [expr $val(x)/2]
set bsy [expr $val(y)/2]
$BS set X_ $bsx
$BS set Y_ $bsy
$BS set Z_ 0.0;

<p>When I run the code, the node color changes and the label is added. However, the shape does not ever change - I have not been able to get it to change either (via changing <code>stime</code>, commenting out stuff, adding, trying different shapes, etc). In addition, when I leave in the label color, it SHIFTS the entire node position from (35, 35) to (0, 0). How would label color shift node position??? Why does my shape never change? What am I doing wrong with label color? Is this an initialization problem within the event scheduler?</p>

<p>As a final note, every node in my whole simulation before 'Play' in nam is pressed starts as a green circle. The colors and labels change AFTER play is hit. </p>

3 Base Stations (eNodes) which are connected with each other through the x2-interface-link. The base stations are all connected to BGP-Routers. The BGP-Routers(I have 15 bgp Routers) are connected with each other in meshed form and have a link to the lteInternet. The lteInternet have a link to sgw, and sgw to pgw.</p>

<p>But OMNeT++ didn't support PCRF, MME. Only pgw and sgw. And I'm not sure what I should do instead of it. Maybe someone have an idea?
I would appreciate any help I could get, because I Need to submit this work in 3 days and I really don't know what to do.</p>

<p>Using the proper additions to dumbagent.h, object files, and <code>make clean, ./configure/pathtoTCL -withVersion=tcl, make</code> I was able to get all these print statements to spit out what I need - as it took me using all the prints to figure everything out.</p>

<p>However, now, I cannot get anything out. I even added additional prints to the constructor to see what was going on:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>DumbAgent::DumbAgent() : Agent(PT_PING) {
    printf(""TEST TEST TEST"");
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""Constructor called."" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    iEnergy = 0.0;
    bind(""energy_otcl"", &amp;iEnergy);
    bind(""addr_otcl"", &amp;addr);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing - all the DumbAgents and the simulation work. But no output. My Tcl Script calls everything with: </p>

<pre><code>for {set i 0} {$i &lt; $val(nn)} { incr i} {
    set dumbagent($i) [new Agent/DumbAgent]
    $ns attach-agent $node($i) $dumbagent($i)
}

#$dumbagent(1) get_energy 1

for {set i 0} {$i &lt; $val(nn)} { incr i} {
    $dumbagent($i) get_energy $i
    puts ""$dumbagent($i), $node($i), $i""
}

#$ns at 19.0 ""$dumbagent(2) get_energy 2""
</code></pre>

<p>Where the first loop, use to print out the constructor items, and the second would print current energy. What is happening here? How can I get my information out?</p>

<p>I know it is calling the correct file because if I completely screw up the dumbagent.cc file, it will not make/configure. I either get no output at all (depending on lines I comment out in Tcl Script) or:</p>

<pre><code>error ""error when calling class $cls: $args"" $...""

<p>These above are some snippets from my simple model that I want to simulate. The problem is that I always get the error in the title and I don't know why. I included all header files, compilation does not print any error/warning but when I start my simulation that errors always pops out. I cleaned the project, I even rebuilt it from scratch, following the line of code that I found on the Manual provided by Omnet but things didn't change.
From what I could learn I'm able to retrieve the controTower module using</p>

<pre><code>controlTower = getModuleByPath(""aerodrome.controltower"");
</code></pre>

<p>or something similar but, since the ""GET CONTRO TOWER INSTANCE"" always appears the problem is in the check_and_cast&lt;>(). Note that I don't get nullptr from getModuleByPath() call.
The complete error message is the following:</p>
